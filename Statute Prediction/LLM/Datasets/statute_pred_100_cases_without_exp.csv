Thereafter [PERSON] filed an appeal to the Additional Commissioner but this was dismissed in [DATE].He then preferred a further appeal to [ORG] but before it came on for hearing the dispute was settled and on [DATE] an application was filed for recording this compromise.The term of the compromise which is of relevance to the present appeal is that [PERSON] was to be recognised as tenant of the land in dispute in other words, the order for evicton was nullified.The compromise was recorded and a decree in terms thereof was passed.Some attempt was made by the Zamindar to have the compromise set aside on grounds which it is not necessary to mention, but these attempts failed with the result, that it left the compromise decree passed by the [ORG] in full force.[CARDINAL]. On the strength of the compromise decree [PERSON] applied for restitution of possession under s.

A brief history of the relevant provisions of the Act is as [DATE].Under the Act as it was originally enacted, there was no provision levying tax on the purchase turnover of the goods dealt with by a dealer as defined in the Act.The [PERSON] was amended by [LAW] no.[CARDINAL] of [DATE] which received the assent of the Governor on and the amending Act came into force at once.The amending Act brought about the following changes in [EVENT].In the long title of the Act, after the word sale, the words or purchase were inserted.[CARDINAL] of [DATE], clause ff of [LAW] of the Act which had undergone some alteration when [PERSON] no.[CARDINAL] of [DATE] came into force was substituted by a new clause which read [CARDINAL]. ff purchase, with all its grammatical or cognate expressions, means the acquisition of goods specified in Schedule C for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration otherwise than under a mortgage, hypothecation, charge or pledge..The words in the above section were substituted by by Punjab Act no.[CARDINAL] of [DATE].[CARDINAL].

The [ORG].The petitioner was promoted as Off.Police Inspector on [DATE], on the recommendation of [ORG] upon reviewing his case.While he was posted as Police Inspector at [GPE] in [DATE], he successfully handled the difficult situation arising at [FAC] where there was a quarrel between [CARDINAL] unions, namely [GPE] and I.N.T.U.C. and received a cash prize of rs.[CARDINAL] and C Note from [ORG], Nagpur District Rural by order dated [DATE].He also received several commendations for tactfully handling the situation at Kamptee on the eve of Dussehra, Muharram, [ORG] and [PERSON] I d festivals in [DATE].During the period from, he was deputed to [GPE] as a Special Security Officer for the [ORDINAL] Non Aligned Conference and was posted at [ORG] for making security arrangements.All of a sudden on [DATE], the petitioner was served with the impugned order of reversion by [ORG], [GPE] from [ORG] to that of Police Sub Inspector with the endorsement that such reversion would not disqualify him for being considered for promotion to in future.[CARDINAL]. It appears from the return filed by [ORG] in that this reversion was based upon the report of that he was not fit to be retained as Police Inspector.The recommendation was based on [DATE] to the effect that the petitioner was given to heavy drinking and had practically become a physical wreck and though young he was wholly unfit to hold independent charge.The adverse entries in [ORG] [DATE] were communicated to the petitioner in.[CARDINAL].

Briefly stated the petitioner was in the service of Punjab Roadways, [LOC], Faridcot Punjab State as a driver.The petitioner was charge sheeted for failing to discharge his duties as a driver properly inasmuch as he caused damage to the Punjab Roadways to the extent of rs.22.50 by not taking the bus no.5803 of which he was the driver on [DATE] from [PERSON] to via Moga, but rather took back the bus from.was held and he was found guilty of the charges levelled against him.The service of the respondent was terminated on [DATE].The Labour Commissioner referred the dispute for adjudication [ORG], Patiala under [SECTION_UNK] of [EVENT], [DATE].The period of forced idleness shall be treated as leave of the kind due and in case no leave is due as leave without pay.The reference stands disposed of accordingly.[CARDINAL]. This order has been impeached by the petitioner by a writ application under [SECTION] before [ORG] and [PERSON] at Chandigarh in Civil Writ Petition no.[CARDINAL] of [DATE], on the ground that the order [ORG] was wrong as though he was held to be entitled to reinstatement with continuity of service, yet without assigning any reason the back wages during the period of wrongful termination was refused to the petitioner in derogation of the terms of the provisions of [SECTION].[CARDINAL]. It has also been submitted therein that in similar cases and in similar circumstances this [ORG] disposing of [CARDINAL] special leave petitions directed payment of of the back wages, during the period the appellants were kept out of employment.It has been, therefore, claimed that order of the [ORG] is illegal and bad and the same needs to be modified by directing payment of back wages for the period of his absence from service due to the said order of termination.[CARDINAL]. The writ petition being [ORG] no.[CARDINAL] of [DATE] against the order of [NORP] urging back wages was dismissed by [ORG] and [GPE] by order dated [DATE].[CARDINAL].

By general concurrence of opinion since [DATE] of yore, manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor has always been considered to be a dangerous and obnoxious trade requiring the strictest vigilance and supervision and even prohibition.It is now firmly established that the Government is the exclusive owner of the privilege of manufacturing and selling intoxicating liquor and that the Government may farm out these privileges for the purpose of raising revenue.The legislatures of the various [GPE] in have enacted excise laws which enable them to raise public revenue by farming out these privileges and further to regulate and supervise the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor.That was indeed curious but things got curiouser and curiouser as [ORG] would certainly have said and as we shall presently see.[CARDINAL]. In response to the advertisement, applications were received by the Excise Commissioner.The [PRODUCT] Commissioner then called all the applicants for discussion in order to ascertain their experience and financial stability.At the conclusion of the discussions and after obtaining intelligence reports, the Commissioner proceeded to make his recommendation to the Government.The Commissioner after referring to the qualifications etc.On receipt of the letter of the [PRODUCT] Commissioner containing his recommendation, the Secretary to the Government wrote to the Commissioner a letter in which he stated The process of establishing bottling plants at different places would inevitably involve financial outlays and time.m ere are no details forthcoming regarding the credit worthiness of these individuals who are to be entrusted with the bottling work.m e same may kindly be furnished.[CARDINAL].
