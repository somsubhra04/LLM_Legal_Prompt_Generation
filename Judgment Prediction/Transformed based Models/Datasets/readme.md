We utilize the Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE) framework, as described in the paper titled "Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation" (available at https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.313/), for the task of predicting and explaining legal judgments.

The complete codebase for the experiments and results mentioned in the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 paper, "ILDC for CJPE: Indian Legal Documents Corpus for Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation," can be found in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Exploration-Lab/CJPE/tree/main.
