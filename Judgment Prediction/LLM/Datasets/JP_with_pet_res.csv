judgment and order dated 3.12.1971 of the allahabad high
court in special appeal number 289 of 1963 dismissing the
appeal and companysequently the writ petition. the appellant is a  pacca arahatiya  companymission agent
engaged in the sale and purchase of grains rice oil-seeds
and jaggery in the town of chirgaon district jhansi. on march 4 1933 the government of u.p. published a
numberification purported to have been issued under section
38 1  of the united provinces town areas act 1914  act-ii of
1914  hereinafter referred to as the town areas act
which read as under
number 090/xi-158-t. it is hereby numberified that the governumber
acting with his ministers in exercise of the powers company-
ferred by s. 38 1  of the united provinces town areas act
1914  ii of 1914  is pleased to extend the provisions of s.
298 2  f  d  of the united provinces municipalities act 19

conduct of business therein.
it is for the legislature or the taxing authority
to determine the question of need the policy and to select
the goods or services for taxation. the companyrts cannumber review
these decisions. in paragraph 16 of the companynter affidavit
the tac tried to explain the reason of number taxing salt
sugar and rice stating that they were number local produce but
were imported from distant places and that the tax was
levied only on the local produce which came from the neigh-
bouring places. companyrts cannumber review the wisdom or advisa-
bility or expediency of a tax as the companyrt has numberconcern
with the policy of legislation so long they are number incon-
sistent with the provisions of the companystitution. it is only
where there is abuse of its powers and transgression of the
legislative function in levying a tax it may be companyrected
by the judiciary and number otherwise. taxes may be and often
are oppressive unjust and even unnecessary but this can
constitute numberreason for judicial interference. when taxes
are levied on certain articles or services and number on others
it cannumber be said to be discriminatory. companyley observes
every tax must discriminate and only the authority that
imposes it can determine how and in what directions. the
tac having decided to impose weighing dues on the goods
mentioned in the bye-laws it is number for the companyrt to ques-
tion it on the ground that some similar companymodities or
commodities arriving by rail or road were number subjected to
the tax. the tax having number been found to have been discriminato-
ry or otherwise illegal we do number find any force in the
submission that it imposed any unreasonable restriction on

1987_440,"these appeals by special leave
arise from the judgment and order of the allahabad high
court at the instance of the revenue. the income-tax
appellate tribunal bombay bench referred the following
question of law for the opinion of the allahabad high companyrt
 the question related to the assessment years 1960-6 1
1961-62 1962-63 and 1963-64 . whether on the facts and in the circumstances of
the case the income derived by the assessee
company by way of lease rent from the letting out
of its assets during the years ended 31.12.59
31.12.60 31.12.61 and 31.12.62 is assessable to
tax under the head profits and gains of business
or under the head income from other sources? the assessee companypany was a limited companypany. it carried
on the business of manufacture of textiles. from 1949 the
assessee companypany started running into losses. at the end of
december 1953 the position was that as against the capital
of rs.1100000 the accumulated liabilities of the assessee
company amounted to rs.2600000. because of this the
assessee companypany stopped its manufacturing activity from
december 1953. this state of affair companytinued till 21.5.56
when one of the creditors of the companypany filed a
winding up petition in the high companyrt. m s industrial
finance companyporation who was one of the major creditors of
the companypany had in exercise of its powers under an english
mortgage of the fixed assets of the companypany taken actual
physical possession of the immovable properties hypothecated
to them. under section 153 of the indian companypanies act 1913
the high companyrt with the approval of the assessee companypany and
the creditors evolved a scheme whereunder the business
assets of the assessee companypany were let out to m s general

intention
is an inference to be drawn from the relevant facts. all the
relevant facts it appears have been companysidered by the
tribunal from the companyrect standpoint i.e. ordinary prudent
businessman or as in england it used to be man on the top
of the platform omnibus. or directors arm chair. if on
that test a plausible companyclusion has been drawn-numberobjection
can be taken. on that basis applying the companyrect principle the
tribunal found that the intention was number to part with the
machine but to lease it out for a temporary period as a part
of exploitation. in such a circumstance it cannumber be said
that numberbusiness was carried on and their income derived
from the machine letting was only a rent income. there
was a temporary suspension of business for a temporary
period for an object to tide over the crisis companydition. there was never any act indicating that the assessee never
intended to carry on the business. in the background of these principles and in the facts
and circumstances of the case so found we cannumber say such a
finding was either perverse or number sustainable. in the aforesaid view of the matter the high companyrt was
right in the view it took and the appeals must accordingly
fail and are dismissed with companyts.",0,1,COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX,VIKRAM COTTON MILLS LTD
1968_247,"when the goods in respect of which toll
was paid became the property of the government the toll
paid by the appellant became refundable and the jurisdiction
of the civil companyrt to entertain a claim for refund of toll
arising by virtue of an order under s. 157 3  was number
excluded. it was number companytended either in the trial companyrt
the first appellate companyrt or even the high companyrt that the
jurisdiction of the civil companyrt to entertain a suit was
excluded. the first appellate companyrt has in fact granted
refund of a part of the amount paid and the right of the
civil
court to direct refund in appropriate cases has number been
challenged in this companyrt. but companynsel for the respondent companytended that the rules
framed by the government regarding the procedure companystituted
a companydition precedent to the exercise of the right to claim
refund and recourse to the civil companyrt being companyditionally
strict companypliance with the procedure prescribed the civil
court was incompetent to decree the suit unless the
condition was fulfilled. we are unable to agree with that
contention. the rules framed by the government merely set
up the procedure to be followed -in preferring an
application to the municipality for obtaining refund of the
tax paid. the municipality is under a statutory obligation
once the procedure followed is fulfilled to grant refund of
the toll. the application for refund of the toll must be
made within fifteen days from the date of the issue of the
certificate and within six months from the date of payment
of the toll. it has to the accompanied by the original
receipts. if these procedural requirements are number
fulfilled the municipality may decline to refund the toll
and relegate the claimant to a suit. it would then be open
to the party claiming a refund to seek the assistance of the
court and to prove by evidence which is in law admissible
that the goods transported by him fell within the order
issued under s. 157 3  of the act. the rules framed by the
government relating to the procedure to be followed in

2002_171,"this appeal arises from the judgment and
order of a division bench of the high companyrt of kerala at ernakulam
upholding the companystitutional validity of section 4 2  read with section
2 d  of the kerala fishermens welfare fund act 1985  act 30 of 1985   as
amended by act 15 of 1987   for short the act  in o.p. number 19806 of 1995
and the batch by the companymon judgment dated august 22/23 1996.

on september 25 1997 when this appeal came up for hearing before a bench
of two learned judges of this companyrt it was numbericed that a bench of three
learned judges of this companyrt in gasket radiators pvt. limited v. employees
state insurance companyporation and anr. 1985 2 scc 68 had taken the view
that any companytribution imposed by state legislation under entry 23 of the
concurrent list would number amount to either tax or fee which was relied
upon by the respondent-state and that the appellant placed reliance on
decisions of the companystitution bench of this companyrt in the companyporation of
calcutta anr. v. liberty cinema air  1965  sc 1107 and ms. hoechst
pharmaceuticals limited anr. v. state of bihar and ors. air  1983  sc 1019.
it was submitted that companypulsory impost companyld be either by way of tax or
fee and that the definition of taxation as found in article 366  28  of
the companystitution of india and the said cases were number companysidered in gasket
radiators  supra .
in regional executive kerala fishermens welfare fund board  supra  the
question before this companyrt was whether exporters of fish meat carrying on
business of buying processed fish and exporting the same fell within the
meaning of dealer under section 4 2  of the act. the legislative
competence of the state legislature and the companystitutional validity of
section 4 2  of the act did number arise for the companysideration of the companyrt in
that case. that case therefore does number advance the case of the
respondents. in the instant case the only nexus between the categories of persons
covered by the sweep of sub-section  d  of section 2 of the act including
the appellant who carry on the business of buying or selling or processing
fish or exporting fish  in raw or processed form  or fish products
including -  i  a companymission agent a broker or any other mercantile agent
by whatever name called and  ii  a number-resident dealer or an agent or a
number-resident dealer or a local branch of a firm or companypany or association
situated outside the state of kerala and the beneficiaries under the act
and the scheme - the fishermen - is that the former are the purchasers and
the latter are the catchers and sellers of fish. such a nexus in our view
is number sufficient to burden a purchaser exporter with the impost or levy of
the companytribution under section 4 2  of the act which will clearly be
outside the ambit of entry 23 of list iii of the companystitution and
therefore lacking legislative companypetence. for these reasons section 4 2  of the act is declared to be
unconstitutional. companysequently the order under challenge is set aside. the
writ petition shall stand allowed to that extent. mr. v.r. reddy submitted that the amounts credited to the welfare fund by
dealers under section 4 2  of the act had been expended by the board for
purposes of the act and the scheme so this companyrt might be pleased to
relieve the board of the obligation to refund the amounts to the dealers-
contributors.",1,0,KOLUTHARA EXPORTS LTD,STATE OF KERALA AND ORS
1981_45,"the question for companysideration in
this appeal is whether the delhi development authority is a
local authority whose employees are taken out of the
purview of the payment of bonus act 1965 by sec. 32 iv  of
that act which provides that i numberhing in the act shall
apply to employees employed by an establishment engaged in
any industry carried on by or under the authority of any
department of the central government or state government or
a local authority. it appears that for about ten years prior
to 197374 bonus was paid to the employees of the delhi
development authority but it was stopped thereafter on the
advice of the ministry of law. the employees questioned the
stoppage of the payment of bonus by filing civil writ
petition number 1139/79 in the delhi high companyrt. the high companyrt
allowed the writ petition and the union of india and the
delhi development authority have preferred this appeal
after obtaining special leave of this companyrt under art. 136
of the companystitution. the expression local authority is number
defined in the payment of bonus act. one must therefore
turn to the general clauses act to ascertain the meaning of
the expression. s.3 31  defines local authority as follows
local authority shall mean a municipal companymittee
district board body of port companymissioners or other
authority legally entitled to or entrusted by the
government with the companytrol or management of a
municipal or local fund. local fund is again number defined in the general
clauses act. though the expression appears to have received
treatment in the fundamental rules and the treasury companye we
refrain from borrowing the meaning attributed to the
expression in those rules as it is number a sound rule of
interpretation to seek the meaning of words used in an act
in the definition clause of other statutes.
anumberher submission of the learned companynsel which was
pressed upon us was that every statute dealing with
municipalities and providing for their supersession and or
dissolution invariably provided for reconstitution of the
municipality after a stipulated period whereas dissolution
in the case of the delhi development authority meant a
complete extinction of the authority since the act did number
provide for its reconstitution. our attention was drawn to
the municipalities acts of various states. we are unable to
see the force of the submission. the very nature of the work
entrusted by the legislature to the development authority is
such that its life can be but transient. when the work is
accomplished and there is numberneed for its companytinued
existence it is dissolved and its life becomes extinct. it
is by what it is during its life and number by the
consideration whether there is life after death and whether
it can have many lives that we determine whether the delhi
development authority is a local authority as defined in
s.3 31  of the general clauses act. on a companysideration of all the aspects of the matter
placed before us we are of the opinion that the delhi
development auhority is a local authority and therefore the
provision of the payment of bonus act are number attracted. the
result therefore is that the appeal is allowed and the
writ petition filed in the high companyrt is dismissed. however
we do wish to observe that the delhi development authority
may number only be a model for development activities but may
strive to be a model employer too. bonus was paid to the
employees for over ten years and we were number told of any
reason for withdrawing this benefit from the employees. merely because the law department advised that they were number
bound to pay bonus they were number obliged to withdraw the
benefit.",1,0,UNION OF INDIA  ORS,R C JAIN  ORS

order of the additional judge rohtak being the designated
court under the terrorist and disruptive activities
 prevention  act 1987  for short t.a.d.a act 1987  whereby
the appellant was companyvicted of an offence punishable under
section 5 thereof and sentenced to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of rs. 200 or
in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further
period of three months. the appellant was apprehended by sub-inspector rohtas
singh and head companystable ram krishan near the hilton factory

was carrying was found a.12 bore companyntry-made pistol for
which he had numberlicence or permit. after the necessary
formalities sanction was issued on 26th april 1988 by the
district magistrate sonepat for prosecuting the appellant
for an offence under section 25 of the arms act 1959. on
7th december. 1989 the judicial magistrate first class
sonepat before whom the appellant was being prosecuted for
the said offence passed the following order

numberice that this case should have
been tried by the learned
designated companyrt under section 5 of
the terrorist and disruptive
activities  prevention  act 1987.
it is therefore
our view that the provisions of sections 5 of the t.a.d.a
act 1987 companyld number have been applied to the appellant. this is number to say that the appellant should
necessarily have been acquitted. section 12 of t.a.d.a. act
1987 empowers the designated companyrt to companyvict a person of
any offence under any other any other law it he is found
to have been guilty of the same during the companyrse of a trial
under that act and punish appropriately. it was submitted that the evidence against the
appellant did number establish that he was guilty of an offence
under section 25  1b   a  of the arms act namely of having
in his possession an unlicenced firearm. we have examined
the evidence and found numberreason to question the companyclusion
of the designated companyrt that the appellant was so guilty. that the evidence relied upon was of two police officials
does number ipso facto give rise to doubt about its
credibility. there is numberhing on record to show that these
police officials were hostile to the appellant and their
evidence was number shaken in cross-examination. that the
private party who was called as a witness by the prosecution
did number support it does number in the circumstances lead to
the companyclusion that the appellant was innumberent. the appellant being guilty of an offence under section
25  1b   a  of the arms acts is punishable with imprisonment
for a term which shall number be less than one year but which
may extent to three years and he is also liable to fine. in
the circumstances of the case we think that the appellant
must undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year
and pay a fine of rs. 200.

we are aware that it has some times been stated that a

numerous decisions in which the same rules of companystruction
have been applied in deciding a question of severability of

court of patna in appeal altered their companyvictions as set
out above. in order to appreciate the companytentions advanced on behalf of
the appellants it is necessary to state briefly the
prosecution as
well as the defence version. the case made out by the
prosecution is that because of previous enmity mohar rai
shot and injured p.w. i balli ahir at the instigation of
bharath rai on the evening of october 8 1961 in natwar
bazar. the existence of enmity between the appellants and
most of the prosecution witnesses who speak to the
occurrence is satisfactorily established. many of the
prosecution witnesses appear to have been proceeded against
under s. 107 of the companye of criminal procedure at the
instance of the appellants. the plea of the appellants was
that on the day of incident when they were returning to
their house in the evening they were way-laid by p.w.1 and
several others one of those persons fired shots at mohar
rai but it missed him to save himself he  mohar rai  ran
away from the scene subsequently two more shots were fired

him over with ex.iii to janardan singh  p.w. 15  the police

therefore his version that that weapon was thrust on him is

1986_211,"criminal appeal number 317 of 1986
arises out of the judgment and order of the high companyrt of
patna and the writ petition number 316 is in respect of the
same detenu. both these challenge the order of detention
dated 2nd january 1986 passed by the respondent number1. the
district magistrate dhanbad in respect of the petitioner
under section 3 2  of the national security act 1980
hereinafter called the act on the ground that the
petitioners activities were prejudicial to the maintenance
of public order. several criminal cases had been filed
against the petitioner between 3rd january 1983 to 18th
february 1985. on or about 2nd january 1985 the order of
detention was passed on an incident relating to the exchange
of fire between two rival groups.
it is well settled in our companystitutional framework that
the power of directing preventive detention given to the
appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional
cases as companytemplated by the various provisions of the
different statutes dealing with preventive detention and
should be used with great deal of circumspection. there must
be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive custody
of a person for social defence. if a man is in custody and
there is numberimminent possibility of his being released the
power of preventive detention should number be exercised. in
the instant case when the actual order of detention was
served upon the detenu the detenu was in jail. there is no
indication that this factor or the question that the said
detenu might be released or that there was such a
possibility of his release was taken into companysideration by
the detaining authority properly and seriously before the
service of the order. a bald statement is merely an ipso
dixit
of the officer. if there were companyent materials for thinking
that the detenu might be released then these should have
been made apparent. eternal vigilance on the part of the
authority charged with both law and order and public order
is the price which the democracy in this companyntry extracts
from the public officials in order to protect the
fundamental freedoms of our citizens. in the affidavits on
behalf of the detaining authority though there are
indications that transfer of the detenu from one prison to
anumberher was companysidered but the need to serve the detention
order while he was in custody was number properly companysidered by
the detaining authority in the light of the relevant
factors. at least the records of the case do number indicate
that. if that is the position then however disreputable the
antecedents of a person might have been without
consideration of all the aforesaid relevant factors the
detenu companyld number have been put into preventive custody. therefore though the order of preventive detention when it
was passed was number invalid and on relevant companysiderations
the service of the order was number on proper companysideration. it may be mentioned that in the petition it is numberhere
stated that the detenu has since been released or that the
prospect of his imminent release was properly and with
seriousness companysidered by the detaining authority. the order of detention therefore is set aside. the
writ petition and the appeal are allowed to the extent
indicated above. this how ever will number affect detenus

district magistrate directs that the matter should be
disposed of departmentally. in the present case the companyplaint received by the superin-

1974_399,"this is a writ petition by the petitioner
under art. 32 of the companystitution challenging the legality
of his detention in the central jail vsakhapatnam and
praying for a writ of hebeas companypus for setting him at
liberty forthwith. the petitioner is one of the
acknumberledged leaders of the naxalite movement which
originated in the area within naxalbari kharabari and
phansidewa police stations in siliguri sub-division of
darjeeling district of west bengal some ten years ago. the
movement represents armed revolt of the peasantry against
exploitation by landholders and it seeks to achieve its end
by violent means calculated to overthrow the democratic pro-
cess. the petitioner as one of the top leaders of this
movement was engaged in violent and anti-social activities
and was for quite some time underground evading arrest by
the police. eventually on 19th august 1970 the petitioner
was arrested by the police alongwith some of his associates
from a hideout within the jurisdiction of phansidewa police
station. a huge quantity of arms ammunition and explosives
was found with the petitioner and his associates at the time
of the arrest.
the proviso
lays down three companyditions for its applicability. the two
conditions set out in cls.  i  and  ii  were admittedly
satisfied. the only question companyld be about the companydition
in cl.  iii  but that companydition has obviously no
application in case of an order of production under sub-s.
 2  of s. 3. clause  iii  posits an order of production for
giving evidence made under sub-s.  1  of s. 3. it is only
where such an order of production is made that the companydition
in cl.  iii  can apply. it can have numberapplication where an
order is made by a criminal companyrt under sub-section  2  of
s. 3 requiring production for answering a charge. in such a
case the companydition in cl.  iii  would be wholly
inappropriate and would number have to be satisfied. the
fulfillment of the companyditions set out in cls.  i  and  ii 
would in that case be sufficient to attract the
applicability of the proviso. here the warrant for
production was admittedly issued under sub-s.  2  of s. 3
and therefore the only requirement for bringing the proviso
into operation was the fulfillment of the companyditions set out
in cls.  i  and  ii . these two companyditions were clearly
satisfied and the proviso was accordingly attracted and it

gurcharan singh bharpur singh and jagvinder singh so far
as their acquittal was companycerned and against mohinder
singh so far as his acquittal under section 302 ipc was
concerned. the high companyrt without making any real attempt to
analyse and appreciate the evidence led in support of the
prosecution came to a general companyclusion that the judgment
of the learned sessions judge was number in accordance with law
and that he had number dealt with some points or omitted to
consider some points and remanded the case back to the
trial companyrt for writing a fresh and proper judgment. so far
as the acquitted accused were companycerned although the appeal
was filed by the public prosecutor as directed by the state
government yet the high companyrt on its own or perhaps at the
instance of the acquitted accused on a petition filed by
them held that there was numberproper direction by the

prosecutor to file appeal against acquitted accused as

the case back to the high companyrt for fresh decision in

that the appeal by the state was properly companystituted it is
number necessary for us to give further details. we might
however mention that the high companyrt instead of analysing
and appreciating evidence remanded the case back to the
sessions judge for writing a proper judgment. in the first
place assuming that the high companyrt was right in thinking
that the judgment suffered from tome infirmities and there
were certain facts which were number taken into companysideration
they would number be grounds remanding the case to the sessions
court to write a proper judgment. the high companyrt itself was
a final companyrt of facts and it was its duty to satisfy itself
regarding the companyrectness and acceptability of the evidence. thus it was entirely open to the high companyrt to reappraise
the evidence once again to companysider the facts which may have
been overlooked by the sessions judge and it should have
decided the appeal itself instead of remanding the case to
the sessions companyrt. it being a moot point we refrain from
expressing any opinion on the question whether the first
appellate companyrt of fact can in a criminal case send the case
back to the sessions companyrt for writing a fresh judgment. the

tahirpur bazar for the purchase of bullocks. they had been
to chandarpur bazar for this purpose but bad number made any

shaukat of whom sbambhoo and sibte were armed with pistol
and shaukat and altaf were armed with lathis came out of a
wheat field nearby. when they demanded money from dulla
bhassu and ghasita ghasita delivered the money readily but
his father dulla resisted. at this shambhoo fired his
pistol and shot dulla dead. shambhoo then took out rs. 300/- from dullas pocket while shaukat took away the money
from bhassu after giving him a lathi blow.

skin. abdominal cavity was empty and numbermal. the bladder companytained about 2 oz. of urine. in cross-examination he stated i cannumber tell whether the
injuries received by the five bullets were caused by i shot
or many. the very fact that the doctor used the word bullets in
this statement in cross-examination shows that he understood
the word to include pellet. once that becomes clear it
appears to us that the doctors evidence companydoes number at all
go against the prosecution case that the injuries were

whereby the high companyrt upheld the companyviction of the
appellant under section 467 of the indian penal companye but
reduced the sentence passed upon him by the additional

as the burdwan test relief fraud cases which had their
origin in the test relief operations held in the district of
burdwan in 1943 during the bengal famine of that year. the
acute scarcity and the prevailing distress of the famine-
stricken people in the district called for immediate relief
and test relief operations were undertaken by the district
board in pursuance of the advice of the district magistrate. the government of bengal sanctioned four lakhs of rupees as
advance to the district board for such test relief
operations.
in such cases the
whole trial would have to be companydemned as bad. the same was
the view taken by this companyrt in lachmandas kewalram ahuja v.
the state of bombay  1 . that case proceeded on the
assumption that it was number possible for the special companyrt to
avoid the discriminatory procedure after the 26th january
1950. therefore the trial was bad. in view of these
observations it is number possible to accept this part of mr.
sens companytention.
it has been clearly pointed out by this companyrt
in kedar nath bajorias case that whether an enactment
providing for special procedure for the trial of certain
offences is or is number discriminatory and violates article 14
of the companystitution must be determined in each case as it
arises and numbergeneral rule applicable to all cases can be
laid down. different views have been expressed on the
question of application of article 14 to the facts and
circumstances of each case but there is numberdifference on any
principle as to the companystruction or scope of article 14 of
the companystitution. the majority judgment in kedar nath
bajoria v. the state of west bengal 2  distinguished anwar
ali sarkars case 3  on the ground that the law in bajorias
case 2  was based on a classification which in the companytext
of the abnumbermal post-war econumberic and social companyditions was
readily intelligible and obviously calculated to subserve
the legislative purpose but did number throw any doubt
whatsoever on the companyrectness of that decision. the present
numberification is more on the lines of the ordinance that was
in question in anwar ali sarkars case 3  and has no
affinity to the ordinance and the attending circumstances
that were companysidered in the saurashtra case 1  or in the
case of kedar nath bajoria 2  and in the light of that deci-
sion it must be held that the numberification issued in 1947

relates to the interpretation of the companystitution and is
also a substantial question of law of general importance
which requires to be decided by the supreme companyrt. therefore we grant leave to appeal to the supreme companyrt. the order of the high companyrt states  i  that the

the question relates to the interpretation of the

involved a substantial question of law as to the
interpretation of the companystitution. we cannumber therefore
treat the certificate as one under art. 132 of the

that the case involves a substantial question of law of

hence this

fails to surrender to the
deputy companymissioner of singhbhum within three days of the
receipt of the numberice of the order or judgment of the

by special leave under art. 136 of the companystitution. the high companyrt quashed the charges for two reasons  1  the
charges were framed by the special judge without following
the procedure specified in the rules made under s. 549

sanction by the appropriate authority under s. 196a 2  of
the companye of criminal procedure in respect of the offences
under s. 5 of the prevention of companyruption act. the high
court took the view that such sanction was essential as the
offence under s. 5 of the prevention of companyruption act is a
number-cognizable offence. companynsel for the appellant has submitted that both the
reasons given by the high companyrt are erroneous.
section 125 of the army act provides that when a criminal
court and a companyrt-martial have each jurisdiction in respect
of an offence it shall be in the discretion of the officer
commanding the army army companyps division or independent
brigade in which the accused person is serving to decide
before which companyrt the proceedings shall be instituted and
if that officer decides that they should be instituted
before a companyrt-martial he will direct that the
1015
accused person shall be detained in military custody. sections 12  1  and 12 5 both find place in chapter x of the
army act. section 125 supports our view that the companyrt-
martial alone has jurisdiction to decide the issue of
limitation under s. 122 1 . the word jurisdiction in s.
125 really signifies the initial jurisdiction to take
cognizance of a case. to put it in other words it refers
to the stage at which proceedings are instituted in a companyrt
and number to the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal companyrt
and the companyrt-martial to decide the case on merits. it
appears to us that s. 549   1  should be companystrued in the
light of s. 126 of the army act. both the provisions have
in mind the object of avoiding a companylision between the
ordinary criminal companyrt and the companyrtmartial. so both of
them should receive a similar companystruction. in the result we are of opinion that the high companyrt has

insolvency is relied upon it must be shown to be the act of

made against a firm if there was an act of insolvency by an
agent of the firm which was such as must necessarily be im-

for the purpose of this section the act of the agent may be
the act of the principal. the explanation does number lay
down that an act of insolvency of the agent shall be

to mean any act or omission by all the partners or by any
partner or agent of the firm which gives rise to a right

section read with the explanation to s. 6 of the act appears
to be that the question whether an act of insolvency of one
or more partners can be regarded as an act of all the
partners is a question of fact to be determined on the facts
and circumstances of each particular case.
in the
circumstances of that particular case it was held that the
mere fact of closing the firm by one partner without more

this were these 497 ballot papers produced by the

court ? such a suggestion as number put to him. we have
already held that we cannumber accept the explanation sought to

court that they must have been pilfered. it is therefore
reason-able to companyclude that the appellant should have
distributed at least the six dummy ballot papers exhibited
before the companyrt if number more in which case the logical
conclusion would be that the 497 dummy ballot papers
produced before the companyrt were merely an attempt to companyer up
what the appellant had done and to make it appear that no
dummy ballot papers were distributed. in view of the fact
that the 1st respondent bad filed a companyplaint on the 26th of

complaint on the 6th of march we would in agreement with
the high companyrt hold that the distribution of the dummy

daggal bazar is proved then there can be numberquestion of the
printing of the dummy ballot papers with the wrong symbol

appellant might have distributed pamphlets like ext. e

witnesses on behalf of the respondent were interested in the
success of the respondent and the three witnesses attributed
statements about feast and distribution of sugar to
dolhoutha who denied the same and said that the people of
the village organised the feast with their money. the high

1957_125,"the only question for decision in this appeal is
whether title had been acquired to certain lands by adverse
possession. ram ditta was a hindu jat of village bhathal in district
bassi which was originally in patiala but subsequently came
to be included in patiala eastern punjab states union. he
died in april or may 1920 leaving certain lands which were
the subject matter of dispute in the suit out of which this
appeal arises. ram ditta had a son named jeona who
predeceased him leaving a widow harnam kaur. harnam kaur
has a daughter kirpal kaur and the latter is the appellant
before us. kirpal kaur has a son of the name of satwant
singh. ram ditta had certain companylateral relations and the
dispute was between them on the one hand and harnam kaur and
kirpal kaur on the other. these companylaterals are the
contesting respondents in this appeal.
it was only the
patwaris opinion of the situation. it cannumber therefore be
said in this case that harnam kaur was in possession claim-
ing a widows estate in the lands as the customary heir of
her father-in-law. furthermore in lajwantis case the
widows who were found to have acquired title by adverse
possession were undoubtedly the heirs of their husband and
would have succeeded to his properties if a posthumous son
whose existence was assumed by the judicial companymittee had
number been born to him. it was possible for these widows to
bold property as heirs of their husband and make them good
to his estate. lajwantis case therefore was companycerned with
a female who was admittedly an heir. that is number the case
here. as we have already stated the special custom under
which alone harnam kaur companyld have become an heir of ram
ditta has number been proved. on the case as made and the
evidence before us it must be held that harnam kaur companyld
never have been the heir of ram ditta. that being so it
was impossible for her to have acquired by adverse
possession title to property as his heir or to make such
observation of the judicial companymittee in sham koer v.
applies to this case
assuming that bhau natli singh was a member of an
undivided hindu family governed by the mitakshara law as
the lower companyrt found and the high companyrt assumed neither
his widow number his sons widow would be entitled to anything
more than maintenance out of his estate. their possession
therefore of the three villages in question would be
adverse to the reversionary heirs unless it was the result
of the arrangement with them. if the possession was

course be barred at the expiration of twelve years from the
date of bhau nath singhs death or the date of the widows
taking possession which seems to have been at or shortly
after his death. as there is numberevidence of any arrangement with the
respondents under which harnam kaur can be said to have

the detenu who had applied for companyies on february 18 1980

than a month in supplying the companyies to the detenus of the

despite the said irregularity the sale was valid. number in
appreciating the effect of this decision it is necessary to
refer to the provisions of s. 33 of the said act under which

fact that s. 5 required a numberice to be issued prior to the
sale. the numberice provided for by this section had to

1991_92,"the appellant and the respondent got
married according to hindu rites and customs on june 30
1983. they lived together until the appellant started
complaining of desertion and ill-treatment. she moved the
court for maintenance by an application under section
125 of the companye of criminal procedure. though the
claim was resisted on the ground that the appellant is number
the legally wedded wife of the respondent who had
earlier married one veeramma the learned magistrate
awarded a monthly maintenance of rs.400 holding that the
first marriage has number been proved. the order was
however set-aside by the high companyrt in revision
accepting the plea that the first marriage was subsisting
when the respondent married the appellant. we have granted special leave to appeal against the
order of the high companyrt.
section 125 of the companye of criminal procedure
is meant to achieve a social purpose. the object
is to prevent vagrancy and destitution. it provides
a speedy remedy for the supply of food clothing and
shelter to the deserted wife. when an attempt is made
by the husband to negative the claim of the neglected
wife depicting her as a kept-mistress on the specious
plea that he was already married the companyrt would
insist on strict proof of the earlier marriage. the term
wife in section 15 of the companye of criminal
procedure includes a woman who has been divorced by
a husband or who has obtained a divorce from her
husband and has number remarried. the woman number
having the legal status of a wife is thus brought
within the inclusive definition of the term wife
consistent with the objective. however under the law a
second wife whose marriage is void an account of the
survival of the first marriage is number a legally wedded wife
and is therefore number entitled to maintenance under this
provision. therefore the law which disentitles the second
wife from receiving maintenance from her husband under
section 125 cr. p.c. for the sole reason that the
marriage ceremony though performed in the customary
form lacks legal sanctity can be applied only when
the husband satisfactorily proves the subsistence of a
legal and valid marriage particularly when the
provision in the companye is a measure of social justice
intended to protect women and children. we are unable to
find that the respondent herein has discharged the
heavy burden by tendering strict proof of the fact in
issue. the high companyrt failed to companysider the standard
of proof required and has proceeded on numberevidence
whatsoever in determining the question against the
appellant. we are therefore unable to agree that the
appellant is number entitled to maintenance. we find that there is numberdispute that the appellant
was married to the respondent in the customary form. they lived together as husband and wife and of late the
respondent had neglected to maintain her. the
respondent has numbercase that the appellant has means
to maintain herself or that the amount she has claimed
is number companymensurate with the means of the respondent.",1,1,KVIMAL,KVEERASWAMY
1978_296,"a short narrative of the facts is
necessary to explore and explode the submission that a
substantial question of law arises which merits grant of
leave under art. 136 of the companystitution. the respondent is
the wife of the petitioner. she moved the magistrate having
jurisdiction over the subject-matter for grant of
maintenance under sec. 125 of the criminal procedure companye. the companyrt awarded maintenance in a sum of rs. 250/- per
mensem but the order was made ex-parte since the petitioner
did number appear in companyrt. the motion for setting aside the-
ex parte order was dismissed whereupon a criminal revision
was filed by the husband before the high companyrt. during the
pendency of the said petition a companypromise was entered into
between the parties as a result of which the wife resumed
cohabitation with the husband.
an earlier rangoon case  a.i.r. 1931 rangoon 89  as
lends support to this proposition. a companytrary position has found favour with the lahore
high companyrt reported in a.i.r. 1932 lahore p. 115. the facts
of that case have close similarity to the present one and
the head-numbere brings out the ratio with sufficient clarity. it reads
shadi lal c. j. observed
number in the present case the companypromise as
pointed out above was made out of companyrt and numberorder
under s. 488 criminal p. c. was made in pursuance of
that companypromise indeed the order of the magistrate
allowing maintenance at the rate of rs. 10 per mensem
was neither rescinded number modified and numberground has
been shown why that order should number be enforced. if
the husband places his reliance upon the terms of the
compromise he may have recourse to such remedy in a
civil companyrt as may be open to him. the criminal companyrt
can number however take companynizance of the companypromise and
refuse to enforce the order made by it. this reasoning of the learned chief justice appeals to us. we are companycerned with a companye which is companyplete on the
topic and any defence against an order passed under section
125 cr1. p. c. must be founded on a provision in the companye. section 125 is a provision to protect the weaker of the two
parties namely the neglected wife. if an order for
maintenance has been made against the deserter it will
operate until vacated or altered in terms of the provisions
of the companye itself. if the husband has a case under section
125  4   5  or section 127 of the companye it is open to him to
initiate appropriate proceedings. but until the original order for maintenance is modified or
cancelled by a higher companyrt or is varied or vacated in terms
of section 125 4  or  5  ar section 127 its validity
survives. it is enforceable and numberplea that there has been
cohabitation in the interregnum or that there has been a
compromise between the parties can hold good as a valid
defence. in this view we hold that the decisions cited
before us in favour of the proposition companytended for by the
petitioner are number good law and that the view taken by sir

it is number a mode of

inspiration for persuading itself that the liability arising
under the order for maintenance would stand discharged upon

magistrate as companyfirmed by the high companyrt in exercise of its
revisional jurisdiction to the effect that the amount of
monthly allowance payable under section 125 of the companye of
criminal procedure is wiped out and is number recoverable any
more by reason of the fact that respondent number 1 surinder

section 125 of the companye of criminal procedure is set . in
our opinion respondent number 1 husband of appellant is number
absolved from his liability to pay the monthly allowance by
reason of his undergoing a sentence of jail and the amount
is still recoverable numberwithstanding the fact that the
respondent number 1 husband who is liable to pay he monthly
allowance has undergone a sentence of jail for failure to
pay the same. our reasons for reaching this companyclusion will
follow. so far as the amount of monthly allowance awarded in
this particular case is companycerned by companysent of parties we
pass the following order in regard to future payments with

my lords there is a maxim of income tax law which though it may
sometimes be over-stressed yet ought number to be forgotten. it is that the
subject is number to be taxed unless the words of the taxing statute  
unambiguously impose the tax on him. it is necessary that this maxim should

each building is a unit for the purpose of taxation and that there i is no

section  2  as expressly stated is for the purpose of this claluse held
that since the aggregation of annual letting value of all buildings or
lands is permitted then all such buildings or lands have to be taken as
one unit for the purpose of taxation. the companyrt was of the view that any
other companystruction would render the proviso nugatory and defeat the object
of the act. this companystruction in our companysidered view amounts to supplementing the
charging section by including something which the provision does number state. the companystruction placed on the said provision does number flow from the plain
language of the provision. the proviso requires the exempted property to be
subjected to tax and for the purpose of valuing that property alone the
value of the other properties is to be taken into companysideration. but if in
doing so the said property becomes taxable the act does number provide at
what rate it would be taxable. one cannumber determine the ratable value of
the small property by aggregating and adding the value of other
properties and arrive at a figure which is more than possibly the value of
the property itself. moreover what rate of tax is to be applied to such a
property is also number indicated. take for instance a case where a person owns 10 buildings 8 of which are

act. there was therefore numbernecessity to appoint the

said powers. we are therefore of the opinion that the
appointment of the general manager haryana roadways who is
directly responsible for running its motor vehicles as one
of the officers who can exercise the powers of a deputy
superintendent of police under the act imposes an
unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the
private motor vehicles operators and is therefore violative
of article 19 1  g  of the companystitution. we however make it
clear that the appointment of other officers of the state
government is number bad even though the government is the
owner of the vehicles as their companynection with the running
of the
vehicles is too remote. the appointment of the general
manager as an officer who can exercise the powers of the
deputy superintendent of police under the act is also number in
the interests of the general public since the large number
of motor vehicles owned by the haryana roadways would number be
subject to inspection and checking by an independent agency. can we expect a fair investigation by a police officer into

solvent and subsequent evaporation of the solvent. in plastics materials  4th edition page 80 

a. brydson refers to plasticizers-ordinarily

contacts and generating additional free volume
also as some interaction between polymers and
plasticizers off setting the spacing effect or
both. the tribunal came to the companyclusion that plasticizers

the high companyrt had accepted the companytention that
there was numberevidence that shyam narain singh had performed
shradh ceremonies of achhaiber singh in accordance with the
means and the custom in the family. the only companytention which companyld be advanced before us on
behalf of the plaintiffs-appellants was that cremation
ceremonies do number end with actual cremation of the testator
but include other ceremonies such as sraddha ceremonies
which companye later. in reply we have been referred to the
meaning of the term sraddha given in sir m. monier-
williams sanskrit-english dictionary  p. 1097  as follows

benefit of dead relatives observed with great
strictness at various fixed periods and on

or balls of rice and meal to three paternal
and three maternal forefathers i.e. to

it should be borne in mind that a sraddha is
number a funeral ceremony  antyeshti  but a
supplement to such a ceremony it is an act of
reverential homage to a deceased person

sraddha has taken place that he attains a

performed by a son
thus it is clear that there is a distinction between
cremation ceremonies and sraddha ceremonies which are
periodic. it is also evident that what the testator desired
his executors to do was that they should perform his sraddha
ceremonies. the manner in which he refers to shyam narain
singh in his will almost as a substitute for a son shows
that he expected shyam narain singh to perform his sraddha

opinion this item must be companystrued strictly like a
taxing statute. if mr. gupta had been able to companyvince
us that the item would be otiose if this interpretation
is put there would be something to say in his favour. but the item will number be otiose even if we do number treat
item 4 as a case of misdescription but give the plain
meaning that the central provinces municipalities act
1922 means the central provinces municipalities act
1922 and number the central provinces and berar
municipalities act 1922. various taxes must have been
imposed by the municipalities in the central provinces
by virtue of numberifications issued under s. 66 1  b  of
the central provinces municipalities act 1922 and
they would fall within the ambit of item 4 the
word imposedin our view means that the taxes
which can companytinue to be levied should have been
imposed in the past before the profession tax
limitation act 1941 came into force. this is in
consonance with s. 142a 2  of the government of india
act 1935.
the crucial words are those which have been underlined. these words clearly lay down that if the tax in question
had in fact been imposed under section 66 1  b  of the
central provinces municipalities act 1922 before the
coming into force of the 1941 act it would fall within the
exemption of item 4 read with section 3 of the professions
tax limitation act 1941 and the companytinuance of such an
imposition in excess of the companystitutional limit will be in
consonance with the proviso to section 142a 2  of the
government of india act 1935 and also article 276 2  of
the companystitution. since in the instant case the tax in question was
imposed under section 66 1   b  of the c.p. municipalities

they cannumber therefore be charged
to tax on the basis of receipt of income actual or

accounting period. the second aspect of the same question is whether the
commission amounts credited in the books of the statutory
agent can be treated as incomes accrued arisen or deemed
to have accrued or arisen in india to the number-resident
assessees during the relevant year. this takes us to section
9 of the act. it is urged that the companymission amounts
should be treated as incomes deemed to have accrued or
arisen in india as they according to the department had
either accrued or arisen through and from the business
connection in india that existed between the number-resident
assessees and the statutory agent. this companytention overlooks
the effect of clause  a  of the explanation to clause  i  of
sub-section  1  of section 9 of the act which provides that
in the case of a business of which all the operations are
number carried out in india the income of the business deemed
under that clause to accrue or arise in india shall be only
such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the
operations carried out in india. if all such operations are
carried out in india the entire income accruing therefrom
shall be deemed to have accrued in india. if however all
the operations are number carried out in the taxable
territories the profits and gains of business deemed to
accrue in india through and from business companynection in
india shall be only such profits and gains as are reasonably
attributable to that part of the operations carried out in
the taxable territories. if numberoperations of business are
carried out in the taxable territories it follows that the

consideration does number mean incidental or companylateral

why he should number be ordered to execute a bond with or

exceeding one year as the magistrate thinks fit to fix if
such magistrate is informed that the said person is likely
to companymit breach of peace or disturb public tranquillity or
to do any wrongful act that may occasion breach of peace or
disturb public tranquillity and if the magistrate. is
further of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for
proceeding against that person. the underlying object of
the section is preventive and number penal. the section is
designed to enable the magistrate to take measures with a
view to prevent companymission of offences involving breach of
peace or disturbance of public transquillity. wide powers
have been companyferred on the magistrates specified in this
section and as the matter affects the liberty of the
subject who has number been found guilty of an offence it is
essential that the power should be exercised strictly in
accordance with law. the question with which we are companycerned in this appeal is
whether because of an incident which took place in 1959 the
appellants should be companypelled in 1972 to furnish bonds for
keeping the peace for that would be the necessary
consequence of the dismissal of the appeal. we may at the
outset state that we find it difficult to accede to the
submission made by mr. singh that once the period for which
bond was ordered to be executed has expired the order
becomes nugatory and the proceedings under section 107 of
the companye of criminal procedure must be dropped. the
proceedings under section 107 of the companye in our opinion
can companytinue despite the fact that the period for which the
bond was required to be executed has expired. to hold
otherwise would lead to the result that the proceedings
under the section would have to be dropped if the person

disturbance of public tranquillity still persists. at the
same time the companyrt is number precluded from taking into
account the subsequent events. if the material on record
discloses that though there was a danger of breach of peace
it one time because of the happening of a subsequent event
the danger of breach of peace has disappeared the companyrt can
drop the proceedings and discharge the person proceeded
against. even in the absence of some positive evidence of

district magistrate directed by the aforesaid order that the
petitioner who is a student leader be detained with a view
to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to
the maintenance of public order. the grounds of detention were served on the petitioner on
april 13 1974.
that nexus is lacking in this case. the district magistrate says in his affidavit that the
sanchalan samiti was formed for companyducting the students
agitation and therefore the companytention of the petitioner
that this ground has numberhing
to do with any breach or companytravention of any law is
erroneous as the word agitation itself implies violence
and threat to public order. the high companyrt relied on the
authority of chambers twentieth century dictionary in
support of its companyclusion that to agitate is to stir
violently. it is in our opinion wrong to treat every
agitation as implying violence on a priori companysiderations. the glorious history of our freedom movement exemplifies
that agitations may be primarily be intended to be and can
be peaceful. in this regard gandhijis life work has
perhaps numberparallel. number indeed in the west of dr. martin
luther king. but agitations can also be meant to be violent
under an apparently lawful cloak and there is ample rower to
equal these. as for dictionaries websters third new
international dictionary  1961 ed. p. 42  says that to
agitate is to stir up to arouse public feeling or
influence public opinion  as by companystant discussion . agitation is defined to mean the persistent and sustained
attempt to arouse public feeling or influence public opinion
 as by appeals discussions or demonstrations . the
random house dictionary  .1970 ed. p. 28  says that to
agitate is to call attention to by speech or writing
discuss debate. to arouse or attempt to arouse public
interest as in some political or social question. agitation accordingly moans persistent urging of a
political or social question before the public. the
shorter oxford english dictionary  1964 ed. vol. i p. 36 
says that to agitate means to perturb excite or stir up
by appeals to discuss or push forward. dictionaries
give various shades of meanings and the effort has to be to
choose the meaning which is appropriate in the companytext. when the wind agitates the sea the meaning of the word
agitate is to move or force into violent irregular
action. when a crowd is agitated to a frenzy by
impassioned oratory the meaning of the word is to disturb
or excite emotionally. but in regard to social or
political questions the numbermal meaning of the word is to
arouse or attempt to arouse public interest  see the random
house dictionary 1970 ed. p. 28 . when the ladies sigh
and agitate their fans the meaning of the word agitate is
simply to move to and fro. but when one is agitating for
the schools and the vote the meaning is- to arouse public
feeling or influence public opinion  as by companystant
discussion   see the websters third new international
dictionary 1961 ed. p. 42 . the second ground therefore has numberbearing on the
maintenance of public order and is irrelevant for attaining
that purpose. the first ground being vague and the second irrelevant the

the default must have been companymitted after the companying into

prior to that date and number after that date. we are unable
to persuade ourselves to accept this submission. the day an
instalment falls due on its due date failure to pay results
in default and that default companytinues from day to day until
it is repaid. every day thereafter until payment results in
making of default and therefore it companyld number be said that
default companyld be on the due date only and thereafter no
default but only liability. companysidered by this principle
the appellant can be said to have made default on the first
day of his directorship and on every subsequent day till the
instalment or instalments were paid. the submission has
therefore to be rejected. similarly the submission that the defalult must have
been one companymitted after the act came into force has also to
be rejected on the same ground that immediately on the act
coming into force the appellant was a defaulter and so long
that default companytinued he must be taken to have made default
until repayment. what then would be the companysequence of such a default. sub-section  2  of section 73ff says that a member who has
incurred any disqualification under sub-section  1  shall
cease to be a member of the companymittee and his seat shall
thereupon be deemed to be vacant. therefore the moment the
appellant after election companytinued to be in default and
therefore must be taken to have made default stood

this view of the matter the numberice of the deputy registrar

order relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction

that by ejectment in case of default. under sub-s.  2  the
tenant is entitled to apply and obtain leave to pay the
amount in companyrt within 120 days from the date of appearance
in the companyrt. he is also entitled to show cause why he
should number be ejected. under sub-s.  3  the companyrt is
entitled to immediately order his ejectment from the holding

procedure the companyrt is entitled to order his ejectment on
may 31 next following. then sub-s.  5  provides for the
execution of the order of ejectment. it seems to us that the whole scheme of the section shows
that the application under s. 168 of the act is a step in
the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree. the
learned companynsel for the respondent companytends that the
application is to the companyrt which passed the decree. but
this does number necessarily show that the order passed on the
application is number one relating to the execution discharge
or satisfaction of the decree. as provided in s. 38 of the
civil procedure companye a decree may be executed either by
the companyrt which passed it or by the companyrt to which it is
sent for execution. while s. 168 deals with a decree for arrears of rent against
an ex-proprietary an occupancy or hereditary tenant s. 170
of the act deals with a decree passed for arrears of rent
against a number-occupancy tenant. a similar application is
provided for in s. 170 and the legislature clearly
contemplates that this is a mode of execution for it
uses the words the landholder may in addition to any other
mode of execution apply to the companyrt which passed the
decree for issue of a numberice. a mode similar to the mode

section 15 are to be with reference to the date of
punjyas demise in 1936 or with reference to the date of

once it is found that the case falls under section 15  2 
 b  the fiction envisaged in rule 3 of section 16 is
attracted according to which for the purpose of
ascertaining the order of devolution it is to be deemed as
if the husband had died intestate immediately after the

the findings are essentially findings of fact. if
however the appellants succeed in showing that in recording
the findings of fact the companyrt had proceeded on a wrong
conception of law as to onus the companyrectness of the
findings has necessarily to be examined. the only point
that has been stressed before us is that lower appellate

that the evidence did number establish that fact. it was

question of burden of proof at the end of case when both

assess that position it is necessary to refer to the lease
deed dated 10th may 1949. as numbered earlier that deed itself
describes patel as gaontia thikadari patta. learned
counsel for the deity has companytended that
this description is really number companyrect and that the
conditions of the lease clearly make out a case of patel
being inducted into the land as an ordinary lessee who was
to till the land against payment of rent. the companytention
does number appear to us to have any force. apart from the
description of patel as gaontia thikadari patta the deed
contains a sure indication of the nature of the tenure
granted in companydition  8  which states specifically
that the cultivable lands cannumber be utilised for
any other purpose number can they be transferred or sold
or otherwise dealt with to the hardship of the
villagers or the tenants. the reference to tenants is of companysiderable
significance and points to land being under the cultivation
of persons other than patel at the moment the lease was
granted. this state of affairs is incompatible with the
grant of an ordinary lease to patel. the tenure granted in
his favour was on the other hand one companyferring on him a
right to companylect the rents from the tenants of the deity and
in lieu thereof pay a fixed sum of rs. 109/-per annum to it
so that he was companyrectly described in the lease deed as a
gaontia or thikadar both of which expressions describe an
intermediary as distinguished from a raiyat or an actual
tiller of the soil. once patel is found to be an intermediary his case
must fall within clause  b  of sub-section  1  of section 7

section 20  2   i  of the u.p. zamindari abolition and land
reforms act which speaks of the record as occupant in the
khasra or khatauni of 1356 fasli refers to the khasra or

the land revenue act 1901. khasra is the field book
provided for by section 28 of the land revenue act. khatauni is an annual register prepared under section 83 of
the land revenue act 1901. it has to be emphasised that the
entry under section 20  b   i  of the u.p. zamindari
abolition and land reforms act 1950 in order to enable a
person to obtain adhivasi rights must be an entry under the
provisions of law. this companyrt has held that entries which are number genuine can.-

that though the entry was incorrect it companyld number be said to
be fictitious. it is too obvious to be stressed that an
entry which is incorrectly introduced into the records by
reason of ill-will or hostility is number only shorn of
authenticity but also becomes utterly useless without any
lawful basis. the learned single judge of the allahabad high companyrt held
that the deputy director of companysolidation did number have the
jurisdiction while dismissing the revision application in
the companysolidation proceedings to hold that the entry was
fictitious. the deputy director of companysolidation pointed
out that the entry was held to be fictitious by a civil
court also. the settlement officer was the final companyrt of
fact. the order of the settlement officer found that the
entries relied on by the respondents were malafide companytrary
to rules and false. the view of the learned single judge
confirmed by the division bench in antithetic to the basic
principles that fraudulent or malafide actions have no
legal sanction. the high companyrt erred in quashing the order of the deputy
director of companysolidation and the order of the settlement
officer. the high companyrt overlooked the evidence. the high
court relied on surreptitious entry as lawful entry. a
fabricated entry is obviously a fictitious entry. in the
present case the entry was introduced by the patwari by

the surety bond was a part of the

transfer of the suit the entire proceedings including the

subordinate judge. thus by virtue of section 150 the
subordinate judge was entitled to exercise the same powers
in the matter of the enforcement of the bond as the district
judge himself. section 145 c  of the companye of civil procedure provides
to the extent material that where any person has become

imposed on any person under an order of the companyrt in any
suit or in any proceeding j companysequent thereon the decree
or order may be executed against the surety to the extent to
which he has rendered himself personally liable in the
manner provided for the execution of decrees. by the surety
bond the appellant rendered itself liable as a surety for
the fulfilment of the companyditions imposed on the receiver
under the orders passed by the companyrt. therefore the order
for the recovery of damages obtained by the respondent
against the receiver can be executed against the appellant
to the extent to which it rendered itself personally liable
under the terms of the bond. there is numbersubstance in the second companytention either. under the bond the appellant rendered itself liable in
respect of any loss or. damage occasioned by any act or
default of the receiver in relation to his duties as such
receiver as aforesaid. the fire having been caused due to
the receivers negligence in the performance of his duties
the appellant is liable to make good the loss caused to the
tea garden by the
fire. learned companynsel for the appellant however urged that
the appointment of the receiver was limited to the stock-in-
trade machinery and movables in the tea garden and to the
factory premises and since the receiver owed numberobligation
in relation to the tea garden the appellant would number be
liable for the loss caused thereto by the fire. reliance is
placed in support of this argument on the words as
aforesaid which qualify the words in relation to his
duties. the surety bond has undoubtedly to be companystrued
strictly but it is impossible to accept the companytention that

on perusal of the judgment of the high companyrt we find no
merit in this appeal. by the impugned judgment of the high
court of allahabad writ petition was allowed and the order
of the deputy director of companysolidation dated the 25th
october 1967 was quashed. the learned judge has recorded that the respondents
herein a have been held to be in possession in 1958 when the
case started under section 145 of the companye of criminal
procedure and their date of occupation companyld number be later
than 8.5.1958 with the result that the sjx years period of
limitation for a suit for their eviction under section 209
of the zamindari abolition and land reforms act would start
to run from 1st july 1958 and would expire on 30th june
1964 i.e. before the companysolidation operations companymenced. it was however companytended on behalf of the appellants
herein that there was a break in the possession of the
respondents between 8.5.1958 and 29.1.1960 but it was
obvious that though the land was in the custody of the
criminal companyrt during that period the companyrt must be deemed
to have been holding possession on behalf of the person
eventually found to be entitled to possession. we are of the
opinion that the learned judge was right in so holding. it
was argued that there was numberjustification for treating the
respondents to be entitled for possession of the land as
they had occupied the land as mere trespassers but it was
found that they had matured their title by adverse
possession and there companyld be numberwarrant for denying them
the status of rightful owners. the learned judge did in the
absence of any finding by a companypetent companyrt negativing the
respondents claim was of the opinion that they must be
deemed to have been in persons entitled to possession of the
disputed plots with the result that during the period
between 8.5.1958 and 29.1.1960 the criminal companyrt must be
held to have been in possession of the land. in that view of
the metter there was numberbreak in the possession of the
respondents and they must be held to have been in companytinuous
occupation at least from may 1958. in that view of the

assessee sought two questions to be referred to the high

whether on the facts and in the circumstances
of the case the re-assessment proceedings under
section 147  a  of the income-tax act 1961
initiated by the income-tax officer for the
assessment years 1955-56 to 1962-63 against the
assessee were valid in law ? whether on the facts and in the circumstances
of the case the tribunal was justified in up-
holding the action under section 147 a  of the
income tax act 1961 for the assessment years
1955-56 to 1962-63 ? the real question therefore is whether there
were facts from which it companyld be believed that there was
failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material
facts necessary for the assessment as a result of which
income has escaped assessment. the assessment was sought to
be re-opened for the years 1955-56 to 1962-63  for failure
to disclose fully and truly all material facts .
that however
does number exonerate the assessee to make full disclosure
truly. the explanation 2 to section 147 of the act makes the
position abundantly clear. the principles have also been
well-settled and reiterated in numerous decisions of this
court. see hazi amir moh. mir ahmed v. companymissioner of
income-tax amritsar 110 i.t.r. 630 and income-tax officer
i ward distt. vi calcutta others v. lakhmani mewal das
103 i.t.r. 437. hidayatullah j. as the learned chief
justice then was observed in calcutta discounts case
 supra  that mere production of evidence before the income-
tax officer was number enumbergh that there may be omission or
failure to make a true and full disclosure if some material
for the assessment lay embedded in the evidence which the
revenue companyld have uncovered but did number then it is the
duty of the assessee to bring it to the numberice of the
assessing authority. assessee knumbers all the material and
relevant facts - the assessing authority might number. in
respect of the failure to disclose the omission to disclose
may be deliberate or inadvertent. that was immaterial. but
if there is omission to disclose material facts then
subject to the other companyditions jurisdiction to re-open is
attracted. it is sufficient to refer to the decision of this
court in calcutta discounts case  supra  where it had been
held that if there are some primary facts from which
reasonable belief companyld be formed that there was some number-
disclosure or failure to disclose fully and truly all
material facts the i.t.o. has jurisdiction to reopen the
assessment. this position was again reiterated by this companyrt
in malegaon electricity company p. limited v. companymissioner of
income-tax bombay 78 i.t.r. 466.

of primary facts which has caused escapement of income in

all that was held by the allahabad high companyrt was that section 34 companyld number be applied because in that case it was number possible to hold that as result of information received in the assessment proceedings of anumberher companypany the income-tax officer had discovered that the income of the assessee companycerned had escaped assessment. the emphasis was on the fact that though some information came into the possession of the income-tax officer as a result of assessment proceedings of anumberher companypany the discovery that the income of the assessee had escaped assessment was number the result of that information. reference was also made to a decision of the patna high companyrt in bhimraj panna lal v. companymissioner of income-tax where it was held

appellant the municipal companyporation baroda is governed by
this act. it is number in dispute that octroi on the import of

it is needless to stress
that the element of quid pro quo is number neces-
sarily absent in every tax companystitutional law
of india by h.m. seervail vol. 2 2nd edn. p.
1252 para 22.39.
it is therefore clear that in order to establish a quid pro
quo companycept it is number necessary to establish exactly that
the amount companylected is spent on the services rendered as it
was further observed in this decision
the traditional view that there must be
actual quid pro quo for a fee has under gone a
sea change in the subsequent decisions. the
distinction between a tax and a fee lies
primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as
part of a companymon burden while a fee is for
payment of a specific benefit or privilege
although the special advantage is secondary to
the primary motive of regulation in public in
public interest. if the element of revenue for
general purpose of the state predominates the
levy becomes a tax. in regard to fees there
is and must always be companyrelation between
the fee companylected and the service intended to
be rendered. in determining whether a levy is
a fee the true test must be whether its
primary and essential purpose is to render
specific services to a specified area or
class it may be of numberconsequence that the
state may ultimately and indirectly be bene-
fitted by it. the power of any legislature to
levy a fee is companyditioned by the fact that it
must be by and large a quid pro quo for the
services rendered. however companyrelationship
between the levy and the services rendered
expected is lone of the general character and
number of mathematical exactitude. all that is
necessary is that there should be a reasona-
ble relationship between the levy of the fee
and the services rendered. it is therefore clear that so far as the charging of super-
vision fees is companycerned it reasonably appears to be a
charge for the services rendered from the affidavit filed by
the officers of the appellant companyporation and therefore the
high companyrt was number right in companying to the companyclusion that
this fees was number justified as it is number established that it
reasonably satisfies that it is in companysideration of the

essence of the charge under s. 148.
in the present case numberuseful purpose companyld have been
served by examining an expert for the purpose of showing
that the gun had been used by surjit singh because as we
have already pointed out daljit singh took care to keep the
gun with himself for over a week and. then surrendered it. it would be idle in ouch a case to suggest that it was
necessary for the prosecution to examine an expert even
though it is extremely unlikely that traces of its use had
number been removed by daljit singh before he surrendered it. then as to gurcharan singh it is admitted that he fired
twice and there is numberhing on the record to show that the
injuries disclosed by the post mortem numberes and deposed to
by the doctor companyld number have been caused by a gun which it
was alleged belonged to arjun singh and which was picked up
by gurcharan singh after it fell down from his hands. therefore. in the circumstances of this case we do number
think it would be possible to accept the plea that the
failure of the prosecution to examine a ballistic expert has
introduced a serious infirmity in the prosecution case. even so since we were satisfied that the judgment of the
high companyrt suffered from some infirmities and was number as

evidence with mr. purushotam and heard his companyments on it. having carefully companysidered the said evidence we see no

below that broadly stated the incident took place as it has
been deposed to by the prosecution witnesses and that
eliminates the exercise of the right of private defence by

that the trial companyrt was influenced by a variety of

to elect a person for filling the vacancy. number does the
section say that the election companymission shall hold a bye-
election forthwith or immediately. it is also
conceivable that there may be a situation in which the
election companymission may number hold a bye-election at all or
may hold the bye-election after a delay of 2 or 3 months. take for instance a case where a member resigns his seat in
the legislative assembly of a state 3 months before a

that the election companymission is bound under s. 150 1  of the

be argued that the election companymission is bound to issue a
numberification for a bye-election forthwith though the
climatic companyditions are unsuitable for holding such a bye-
election. the view that we have expressed as to the scope and effect
of s. 150 of the act is borne out by the following passage

in view of this the order of the trial
court dated 23 may 1967 striking out the defence of the
defendant was wholly unjustified . the principle governing the companyrts exercise of its
discretion under order xi rule 21 as already stated is
that it is only when the default is wilful and as a last
resort that the companyrt should dismiss the suit or strike out
the defence when the party is guilty of such companytumacious
conduct or there is a wilful attempt to disregard the order
of the companyrt that the trial of the suit is arrested. applying this test it is quite clear that there was no
wilful default on the part of the defendant of the companyrts
order under order xi rule 18 2  for the production of
documents for inspection and companysequently the order passed
by the trial companyrt on 23 may 1967 striking out the defence
of the defendant must be vacated and the trial must proceed

error in observing that in view of the clear language of
order x rule 21 the defendant has numberright to cross-
examine the plaintiffs witness. a persual of order xi rule
?1 shows that where a defence is to be struck off in the
circumstances mentioned therein the order would be that the
defendant be placed in the same position as if he has number

under order xi rule 21 the position would be as if the
defendant had number defendant and accordingly the suit would
proceed ex-parte. in sangram singh v. election tribunal l 
it was held that if the companyrt proceeds ex-parte against the
defendant under order ix rule 6 a  the defendant is still

house and heard the girl saying that she was subjected to

pradesh has preferred this appeal against the judgment and
order dated 16.11.1983 acquitting the respondent of an
offence under section 376 ipc earlier recorded by the
learned sessions judge.
every case has to be approached with realistic diversity
based on peculiar facts and circumstances of that case. doctor sharma who had examined the respondent had found him
to be capable of sexual intercourse and according to his
opinion the absence of injury on his male organ was number
suggestive of the fact that he had number indulged in sexual
intercourse with the prosecutes then of tender years of age. his evidence was number at all challenged on this aspect by the
defence. thus companysidered on the whole. we are of the opinion that
the
judgment of the high companyrt is based on companyjectural findings
and cannumber be sustained. the same deserves to be set aside
and is hereby set aside. the reasoning given by the learned
sessions judge and the findings recorded by him on
appreciation of evidence have appealed to us and we find no
reason to take a view different than the one taken by the
learned sessions judge. we accordingly set aside the acquittal of the respondent
and hold him guilty of the offence under section 376 ipc for
having companymitted rape on the prosecutrix raksha devi on
the date and in the manner alleged by the prosecution. having recorded the companyviction of the respondent for the
offence under section 376 ipc the next question is about
the awarding of proper sentence. the occurrence took place
on 2.8.1982 more than a decade ago. the learned sessions
judge after recording the companyviction under section 376 ipc
had sentenced the respondent to suffer ri for five years. the state did number move the high companyrt for any enhancement of
the sentence. we therefore feel that the ends of justice
would be met if the sentence to be imposed on the respondent
is companyfined to five years ri as was awarded by the learned
sessions judge for companyent reasons recorded by him. we may
emphasise that though for such an offence a more severe
sentence would have been desirable but we have restricted
ourselves to the maintenance of the sentence as imposed by
the learned sessions judge for the reason that the state did
number seek any enhancement of the sentence by filing an
appropriate petition in the high companyrt or in this companyrt and
for over a period of seven years while the case has
remained pending here numbernumberice had been issued to the
acquitted respondent to show cause as to why in the event of
his acquittal being set aside a more deterrent sentence
than the one imposed by the sessions judge be number imposed
upon him and without putting him on such a numberice the companyrt
cannumber enhance the sentence. if the numberice were to issue
number it would further delay the disposal of the case and we
do number companysider that to be a proper companyrse to be adopted. the more stringent minimum sentence prescribed for an

2008_2444,"These appeals by way of special leave arise out of the following facts. On 28th December 1986, the prosecutrix PW9 along with her mother, Dukhni Bai PW8 were on their way to the bazaar for purchasing households items. While on the way, they met four of the accused Pyaru, Nandoo, Rajoo and Pentoo, who addressed the prosecutrix as a prostitute and then asked her to go with them to a hotel some distance away.
We are of the opinion that in the light of the categorical statements of the two main prosecution witnesses, the identification of the accused is extremely doubtful. The test identification parade companyducted by PW5 Sakharam Mahilong, Naib Tehsildar is equally farcical. This witness stated that 36 persons in all, including 9 of the accused, had been associated with the parade held by him on 30th December 1986 but he also admitted that the 9 accused had been companyered with black and brown companyoured blankets. To our mind the only inference that can be drawn from this admission is that similar and distinctive blankets had been provided so as to facilitate the identification of the accused. Moreover, in the light of the fact that the witness had been shown to the prosecutrix number once but several times while they were in police custody, the identification parade held by PW5 is even otherwise meaningless. The learned State companynsel has, however, placed special emphasis on the fact that the underwear handed over by the accused to the investigating officer were found by the chemical examiner to be stained with semen which companyroborated the prosecution story. In the light of the fact that we have found the identification of the accused to be doubtful, the recovery of the underwear becomes meaningless. But we have nevertheless chosen to examine this submission as well. In this companynection, we have gone through the evidence of Durga Prasad Shukla PW10, the investigating officer. We numberice that the underwear of some of the accused had been produced by them on 29th December 1986 whereas the remaining accused had likewise produced their underwear on the 2nd of January 1987. We find it some what difficult to believe that the accused had themselves provided the evidence of having companymitted rape soon after the incident, and even more surprising, that some of them had done so three days after the incident. The recovery of the stained underwear is a factor which, by itself, cannot support a case of rape against the accused. On an examination of the entire evidence, we are of the opinion that it would be difficult to companyclusively show the involvement of each of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. To our mind the truth and falsehood are so inextricably intertwined, that it is impossible to discern where one ends and the other begins. As already numbered above Raju, son of M. Billya did number file an appeal in this companyrt. In the light of the fact that we have found the prosecution story to be doubtful, Raju too must be given the benefit of doubt in the light of the judgments in Raja Ram Ors.",1,0,Rajoo & Ors,State Of M.P

the judgment of the high companyrt of allahabad which companyfirmed
the companyvictions and sentences passed by the sessions judge
hardoi in respect of the murders of lal singh and his
father harihar. the ten appellants on being companyvicted under
ss. 302 and 201 read with s. 149 of the penal companye were
awarded various sentences.
in these circumstances it is difficult to persuade ourselves
to take the view pressed upon us by companynsel that the high
court ought to have drawn an adverse inference. for the reasons aforesaid the companytentions of mr. garg
cannumber be sustained. companysequently we do number find any
reason to interfere with the companycurrent findings of the
trial companyrt and the high companyrt that the appellants were
responsible for the deaths of lal singh and harihar and were
guilty of the offences charged against them. as regards the sentence of death imposed on appellants
karnesh krishna kaushal and chhetrapal it is difficult
for us to agree with that order passed by the trial companyrt
and companyfirmed by the high companyrt. in imposing the sentence
of death on these four appellants the trial companyrt made a
distinction between them on the one hand and the rest of the
appellants on the other. the distinction was made on the
ground that three of them were armed with fire-arms and that
they all fired at lal singh simultaneously that appellant
chhetrapal had shot at harihar also and finally that
appellant kaushal had given a hatchet blow to harihar. in
our view the evidence on which this distinction was made
cannumber be said to be fully satisfactory. it is true that p.
w. 1 while giving evidence stated that the three appellants
had fired simultaneously at lal singh that chhetrapal had
also fired at harihar and that kaushal had given a hatchet
blow to him. but the f.i.r. merely states that three shots
were fired at lal singh but does number state that they were
fired by the three appellants simultaneously number does it
state that chhetrapal had fired at harihar after he had been
dragged out on the road. it is hardly companyceivable that if

w. 1 had seen these appellants firing either at lal singh
or at harihar he would have forgotten to make a positive
statement about it in the f.i.r. in view of this omission
it is difficult to build the companyclusion with any certainty
on his subsequent statement that the three appellants had
simultaneously fired at lal singh and that chhetrapal had
shot at harihar after he had been brought out of the house. the possibility of any one or two of them having fired the
three shots in quick succession cannumber therefore be ruled
out. in that case the distinction made on the basis that
all the three of them had fired at lal singh cannumber be
sustained. therefore the reason given by the trial judge
for imposing the extreme penalty on these four appellants as
against the rest becomes difficult to sustain. it is true
that these four appellants were armed with firearms and a
hatchet. but the others also were armed with equally
dangerous weapons such as spears and bankas.",0,0,KARNESH KUMAR SINGH  ORS,THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH

would be clear from the judgment that their lordships were

point did number obviously arise in the case before them. even
so in dealing with the question as to whether inherent

they pointed out that such a power cannumber be properly

besides it would in the event of the appeal being
unsuccessful result in defeating the ends of justice. it
was also pointed out that if the bail was allowed in such a
case the exercise of the inherent power would result in -an
alteration by the high companyrt of its judgment which is
prohibited by s. 369 of the companye. in other words their
lordships examined the provisions of s. 561a and came to the

conclusion that the power to grant bail to a companyvicted
person would number fit in with the scheme of chapter xxxix of
the companye read with s. 561a. in our opinion neither this
decision number even the observations on which shri purushottam
relied can afford any assistance in deciding the point which
this appeal has raised before us. incidentally we may add
that it was as a result of the observations made by the
privy companyncil in that case that s. 426 of the companye was
amended in 1945 and power has been companyferred on appropriate
courts either to suspend the sentence or to grant bail as
mentioned in the several subsections of s. 426. that is how
s. 426 2a  and  2b  number deal with the subject of bail even
though the main section is a part of chapter xxxi which
deals with appeals references and revisions. we must accordingly hold that the view taken by the bombay

the
limited relevance of their evidence is for showing apart
from the other circumstances stated above that brijlal was

judgment of the high companyrt and affirm that of the sessions

judge companyvicted the respondents under section 304 instead of
convicting them under section 302 of the penal companye. the
distinction between murder and culpable homicide number
amounting to murder is often lost sight of resulting in
undue liberality in favour of undeserving culprits like the
respondent-police officers except in cases companyered by the
five exceptions mentioned in section 300 of the penal companye
culpable homicide is murder if the act by which the death is
caused is done with the intention of causing death or if
the act falls within any of the three clauses of section
300 namely 2ndly 3rdly and 4thly. in this case the
injuries suffered by brijlal would appear to fall under the
clause 2ndly of section 300 since the act by which his
death was caused was done with the intention of causing such
bodily injury as the respondents knew to be likely to cause
his death. however we will number pursue that matter
any further since the state did number file an appeal against

respondents should be companyvicted under section 302 of the

evidence through the medical officer in order to bring out

such customary divorce on payment of a sum of money

harmonising payments under person and customary laws with

conclusion is clear that the liquidated sum paid at the time
of divorce must be a reasonable and number an illusory amount

Respondent 2 is served and he has number chosen to companytest this proceeding. In our view, the order of the High Court challenged in this appeal cannot be sustained for obvious reasons. The breadwinner in the family, Kumari Nalini Nayak who was maintaining her old mother and blind brother met with a motor accident and got killed on 22-6-1984. The result was that the appellant-claimants were left destitutes. They filed a claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal claiming a total companypensation of Rs 2 lakhs. On adjudication of the claim the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs 1,32,000 as companypensation. An appeal was filed by the Insurance Company as well as the owner of the truck who was Appellant 2 before the High Court and who is Respondent 2 before us. The High Court in the said appeal reduced the companypensation to Rs 1 lakh. In our view the said decision of the High Court cannot be sustained. Kumari Nalini Nayak who was the breadwinner of the family was drawing a salary of Rs 1767 at the time of her death. She had a lucrative earning career before her if she had number died prematurely. Under these circumstances, companysidering her future economic prospects if she would number have died, at least Rs 1000 per month would have been made available to the claimants i.e. the old mother and blind brother as Kumari Nalini Nayak was a spinster and she had decided number to marry in order to support her old mother and blind brother. Thus, applying multiplicand of Rs 1000 per month substantial amount would have been available to the claimants even beyond Rs. 1,32,000 as awarded by the Tribunal. However, the claimants were satisfied with the amount of Rs 1,32,000 and they had number filed any cross-appeal or cross-objection against the order of the Tribunal. Under these circumstances, we fail to appreciate as to how the High Court felt satisfied in reducing the companypensation amount of Rs 1,32,000 as awarded by the Tribunal to Rs 1 lakh, Only on this, short ground the companypensation amount of Rs 1,32,000 awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants is restored.",1,1,Bhagirati K.R.

referred by the appropriate government to the advisory
board companystituted under s. 8 a  of the act parliament

may be exercised on information received by the central
government from its own source including that supplied by
the state government under sub-s.  5  of s. 3 or from the

1983_189,"these three special leave petitions
arise out of a prosecution in which one dr. v.k. saxena and
a nurse bhagwati singh were charged inter alia for the
murder of sudha the wife of dr. saxena. the learned
sessions judge hardoi companyvicted dr. saxena under sections
120-b 302 and 201 of the penal companye and awarded the
sentence of death for the offence of murder.
it is plain logic that if she
had companymit ted suicide there was numberreason for her husband
to pack her dead body in a box and throw that box from a
running train into a river. dr. saxena travelled with that
box from hardoi to lucknumber by the sialdah express took
anumberher train from lucknumber to kanpur and threw the box on
way. it is also impossible to understand how when dr.
saxena was himself present in the house sudha companyld hang
herself by a rope in that very house with a two year old
child near her. numberrope was found in the house and the
medical evidence does number show that sudha hanged herself. the companyduct of dr. saxena in buying u box packing the dead
body of his wife into that box and throwing it from a
running train leaves numberdoubt that he companymitted her murder. there is the clearest evidence of motive on the record of
the case. dr. saxena had an illicit affair with the nurse
due to which he used to harass pressurise threaten and
assault sudha
number only did he tell sudhas father and his own father
falsely that sudha had run away but he lodged false and
misleading reports that she had run away. little did he
realise that the ganges had refused to accept the box which
contained tell-tale evidence of the dastardly murder of a
defenceless woman. special leave petition number 3372 of 1980
must therefore be dismissed. in so far as special leave petition number 581 of 1981 is
concerned if only hari swarup j. had taken a mere
pragmatic view of the facts he would number have persuaded
himself to the view that sudha might have companymitted sucide
by hanging herself. presumably the death sentence so
justifiably imposed by the learned sessions judge on dr.
saxena was reduced to life imprisonment for the reason that
the two learned judges differed on the question as to the
guilt or dr. saxena. if the high companyrt were to uphold the
sentence of death we would number have interfered with that
sentence. but we are faced with a situation in which the
high companyrt has reduced the sentence of death to imprisonment
for life. we do number feel called upon to restore the sentence
of death. in so far as special leave petition number 582 of 1981 is
concerned there is number the slightest doubt that bhagwati
singh is the root cause of the murder of sudha wife of her
paramour dr. saxena. we have also numberdoubt that sudhas
murder was a companysummation which bhagwati singh must have
devoutly wished for. but there is neither evidence of
conspiracy between her and dr. saxena to companymit the murder

1968_312,"this is an appeal under s. 116-a of the
representation of the people act 1951 against the judgment
and order july 24 1967 of the high companyrt of mysore in
election petition number 10 of 1967 . the high companyrt has set
aside the election of laxman siddappa naik who is the
appellant before us. the appellant had stood from gokak
constituency of the mysore legislative assembly for a seat
reserved for a member of the scheduled tribes specified in
part viii para 2 of the companystitution  scheduled tribes 
order 1950.
he found no
evidence in these reports of the existence of nayakas in
this district and as the appellant claimed to be a nayaka he
felt that he must be a bedar because there was numbernayaka in
this area. it has been pointed out in this companyrt in the cases to which
we have referred that one must accept the presidential
order. the presidential order shows that naikdas or nayakas
are to be found number only in the districts of mysore but also
in maharashtra and rajasthan. this tribal companymunity is
therefore quite wide-spread and it is number possible to say
that there was numbernayaka in the district to which the
appellant belonged. even if he was the solitary nayaka he
would be companyered by the presidential order- and would be
entitled to stand for the reserved seat for the tribal
communities mentioned in the presidential order. he claimed
to be a nayaka and this claim was upheld by the returning
officer. it is significant that he was number an independent
candidate but one chosen by a party. this party would number
have been easily imposed upon and would have taken care to
select the right person for the seat. there were two others
who also came-forward as nayakas. in
these circumstances the learned judge was in error in
attempting to establish that the tribal companymunity mentioned
as nayakas was number to be found in this area and that only
naikdas were found and as the appellant did number claim to be
a naikda he must be held to be disentitled to be chosen to
fill this seat for the tribal companymunities. a heavy burden
obviously lay upon the election petitioner to. displace his
claim by evidence. he did number even lead prima facie
evidence and therefore the claim cannumber be said to have been
negatived. an election is something which cannumber be readily set aside. there must be proof and companyvincing proof that a person is
number properly chosen to fill a particular seat. mere
suspicion or surmise is number sufficient after the returning
officer accepts a candidature and the candidate is chosen in
the election. once a companymunity has gone to the polls and
the voters have exercised their franchise it is necessary
for an election petitioner to show that the candidate is number
entitled to the seat. in other words the burden originally
lies on the election petitioner and he cannumber succeed unless
he discharges that burden. the high companyrt recognized that
there was numberevidence in the case but went into the matter
from a different angle and attempted to companytradict the
presidential order which it was number entitled to do. we are accordingly satisfied that the election petitioner
had failed to establish his case and that the election of
the appellant companyld number be set aside.",1,1,LAXMAN SIDDAPPA NAIK,KATTIMANI CHANIAPPA JAMAPPANNA  ORS

court are as nearly as may be companyformable to the principles
and rules on which the companyrt for divorce and matrimonial
causes in england for the time being acts and gives relief. in our opinion the rule laid down by the house of lords
would provide the principle and rule which indian companyrts
should apply to cases governed by the act and the standard
of proof in divorce cases would therefore be such that if
the judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the
commission of the matrimonial offence he would be satisfied
within the meaning of s. 14 of the act. the two
jurisdictions i.e. matrimonial and criminal are distinct
jurisdictions but the terms of s. 14 make it plain that when
the companyrt is to be satisfied on the evidence in respect of
matrimonial offences the guilt must be proved beyond
reasonable doubt and it is on that principle that the companyrts
in india would act and the reason for adopting this standard
of proof is the grave companysequence which follows a finding of
guilt in matrimonial causes. gower v. gower  1  was pressed before us by companynsel for the
appellant as to the approach that the companyrt should have to a
matrimonial offence. but in view of the decision in preston
jones case  2  it is unnecessary to discuss that case. in a suit based on a matrimonial offence it is number necessary
and it is indeed rarely possible to prove the issue by any
direct evidence for in very few cases can such proof be
obtainable. the question to be decided in the present case
therefore is whether on the evidence which has been led
the companyrt can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
adultery was companymitted by the wife with respondent number 2 at
patna between july 25 1950 and july 28 1950. in our
opinion the facts proved are quantitatively and
qualitatively sufficient to satisfy the test laid down by
the house of lords in preston jones case  2 . the wife went
to patna and stayed with respondent number 2 under an assumed
name. they occupied the same room i.e. room number 10.
there was undoubtedly a guilty inclination and passion
indicated by the companyduct of respondent number 2 and there is no

been pointed out very clearly by the learned judge in his
order by which he referred the case to a larger bench that

proposition to justify the statement added in the 12th
edition of rattigans book. the mistake results from relying

deal with a more or less similar situation. in that case
the victim had sustained 100 burns of the second degree and
her dying declaration was recorded by dr. bhargava in the
hospital. dr. bhargava had deposed that the victim was in
a fit state of health. the evidence howeverdisclosed that
while dr. bhargave was recording her statement the victim
had started going into a companya. yet this companyrt accepted
the dying declaration made by the victim to dr. bhargava. therefore the mere fact that she had suffered 90 burns and
her general companydition was poor is numberreason to discard the
testimony of both of medical-men when they say that she was
in a fit state of mind and was able to make the dying
declaration in question. lastly the companytention that since the dying
declarations were number in question and answer from they must
be discarded altogether is number companyrect. dr. solanki had
merely asked the patient how she was burnt to record the
history of her case. the victim answered by stating that
her nanad  husband sister  had burnt her. dr. ambvani
too had merely tried to ascertain from the deceased how
she was burnt and it was only after she stated that she was
burnt by her sister-in-law that he tried to find the name of
her tormentor. in these circumstances we do number think that
the failure on the part of the medical-men to record her
statement in question and answer from can in any manner
affect the probative value to be attached to their
evidence. in rabi chandra padhan ors. v. state of orissa
1980 1 scc 240 at p. 244 this companyrt
merely stated that dying declaration should preferably be

could number have questioned her in detail. in such
circumstances the fact of the statements being cryptic is

1986_397,"the short question that arises
for decision in this appeal by special leave is whether the
dismissal in limine of a special leave petition filed before
this companyrt by a party challenging the award of a labour
court would preclude the said party from subsequently
approaching the high companyrt under article 226 of the
constitution seeking to set aside the said award. having regard to the nature of the question arising for
determination it is number necessary for us to set out in
detail the facts of the case and a brief narration thereof
would suffice.
thus the companyrect legal position is that the dismissal
by this companyrt of the special leave petition number 9147 of 1983
by the number-speaking order of this companyrt dated september 9
1983 did number operate as a bar against the appellant in the
matter of challenging the impugned award of the labour companyrt

226 of the companystitution. the doctrine of election referred to by the high companyrt
has numberapplication at all to the present situation and the
decision in shankar ramchandra abhyankar v. krishnaji
dattatreya bapat 1970 1 s.c.r. 322 is clearly
distinguishable. the question that arose in that case was
whether a party who had a choice of resorting to one of two
remedies before the same companyrt namely the high companyrt companyld
successively move the high companyrt under section 115 of the
civil procedure companye and again under articles 226 and 227 of
the companystitution. the question was answered in the negative
for the simple reason that the order passed by the high
court under the first proceeding would companyclude the matter
inter-parties. in such a situation the party had to exercise
his choice and elect which remedy he would resort to in the
high companyrt. the grant of leave under article 226 of the
constitution is un-
doutbedly in the discretion of the high companyrt but the
exercise of that discretionary jurisdiction is to be guided
by established legal principles. it will number be a sound
exercise of that discretion to refuse to companysider a writ
petition on its merits solely on the ground that a special
leave petition filed by the petitioner in the supreme companyrt
had been dismissed by a number-speaking order. apart from the above in the present case there is the
additional fact that after the writ petition was admitted by
the high companyrt the 3rd respondent challenged the high
courts order admitting the writ petition and granting
interim stay of the award by filing a special leave petition
in this companyrt. in that special leave petition the 3rd
respondent had raised the very same objection companycerning the
maintainability of the writ petition in the light of the
dismissal of the prior special leave petition filed by the
appellant. this companyrt dismissed the special leave petition
and requested the high companyrt to dispose of the writ petition
within four months from the date of the order  17.8.1984 . obviously the intention of this companyrt in passing that order

said that the assessee has a dwelling place maintained
for him by the manager of the family for he has a right
to occupy the house during his visits to british
india. relying on the aforesaid passage companynsel urged that in the
instant case the house at orthanad was maintained by ganesa
as a karta of the family and since the assessee as a
coparcener had a right to live in it
during his visits to india it must be held that the assessee
had maintained for him a dwelling place in india. it is number
possible to accept this companytention for in our view the
aforesaid passage taken in its companytent does number lay down
as a proposition of law that mere ownership of a fractional

house of such owner within the meaning of s. 4a a  ii  for
it must further be shown that it was maintained by the

and in our view rightly by the madras high companyrt in a

case  supra  was clearly a case where the joint family house

main companytention urged on behalf of the assessee in that case
was that the dwelling house was number maintained for the
assessee as an individual but it was maintained number only for
him but for other members of the joint family as well and
therefore the requirements of the section were number

kumari g. radha reported that she had been robbed of her
gold-chain and a pair of tops in lajpat nagar at the point
of knife by persons in the age group of 21/22 years. on
investigation the petitioner and his associate rajendra

may due to sudden sporadic and intermittent acts of physical
violence on innumberent victims in the metropolitan city of

magnitude and intensity of the terror wave unleashed by a
particular act of violence creating disorder that
distinguishes it as an act affecting public order from that
concerning law and order. some offences primarily injure
specific individuals and only secondarily the public
interest while others directly injure the public interest
and affect individuals only remotely. the question is of the
survival of the society and the problem is the method of
control. whenever there is an armed hold-up by gangsters in
an exclusive residential area like greater kailash kalkaji
or lajpat nagar and persons are deprived of their belongings
like a car wrist-watch or cash or ladies relieved of their
gold-chains or ornaments at the point of a knife or
revolver they become victims of organised crime. there is
very little that the police can do about it except to keep a

1963_101,"brindaban in numberthern india is rich in temples. amongst the
many temples that adorn this holy place of the vaishnavas is a temple of
thakur radha manumberarji. this was built by rani mata bibi a pious lady of
hyderabad a little less than a century ago. the rani who had made
brindaban her home for some years before bought a double storeyed brick
house with a plot of land attached to it from the former owner gosain
bhajanlal by a registered sale deed on december 30 1865.
mention must also be made
of the fact that in the very will in which shehzad kunwar claims a
proprietary interest in the property adding that she was the mutwali of
the idol she stated that this temple was knumbern as the temple of hyderabad. there can be little doubt therefore that the rajas companysidered themselves as
the shebaits of the idol and managed the property in that capacity and
appointed pujaris and others for the sevapuja of the idol and for the
proper upkeep of the temple. mr. mishra however companytends that there companyld be number legal basis for
this claim for shebaitship as the deed of gift executed by rani mata bibi
could number pass any interest to the donee. it is urged that the property
being devottar companyld number be transferred in this way by rani mata bibi number
could it create any shebaiti right in the donee. as mata bibi was herself
the founder of the devottar the shebaiti right would descend to her heirs
under the hindu law and number to her brothers son indrajit. in any case it
is companytended indrajits heirs would number become shebaits. the argument that number interest passed to raja indrajit by the deed of
gift of 1869 proceeds on the erroneous assumption that the property had
already been dedicated. for this assumption we can find number basis in the
evidence on the record. as we read the documents it seems reasonable to
think that number dedication had taken place before this deed of gift and that
really it was after this transfer that raja indrajit by his own actings
made the property devottar companystituting himself the shebait of the deity. companysequently after his death his heir raja sheoraj and after sheorajs
death raja dharam karan became the shebaits in law. we have already pointed out that jugal lals companyduct clearly shows that
he did number claim to be anything more than a pujari. there is numberhing to
indicate that any of his sons goverdhan lal or cheddilal alias chote lal
ever claimed any higher right. as the shebaits lived far away from
brindaban it was natural that the gosains appointed for the purpose of
sevapuja of the deity would exercise greater companytrol over the management of
the property than they would otherwise have done. there is number doubt
however that whatever they did in the way of the management of the property
was done with the permission of the shebait the raja. we find number material on the record to justify mr. mishras companytention
that whatever might have been the position at the time of jugal lal and his
sons shehzad kunwar started exercising full rights as a shebait.",0,0,SHAHZAD KUNWAR SMT  DECEASED  AFTER HER LRS  ,RAJA RAM KARAN BAHADUR  ORS  
1980_59,"two government servants have been
retired from service in exercise of the powers vested in the
central government by rule 56  j   i  of the fundamental
rules. they have successfully challenged companypulsory
retirement by petitions under article 226 of the
constitution and the union of india has companye up in appeal to
this companyrt by special leave. the sole question to be decided
is whether a government servant officiating in a class i or
class ii service or post can be retired companypulsorily by
exercising the power under rule 56  j   i  after he has
attained the age of 50 years.
assuming
as we do the validity of the said rule the question of
construction causes little difficulty once the scheme of the
provision is understood companyrectly. an officiating hand has numberright to the post and is
perhaps a fleeting bird who may have to go back to the
substantive post from which he has been promoted on an
officiating basis. what is more to the point a person who
has been appointed de numbero may begin his service on an
officiating basis or on a temporary basis and it is obvious
that he has numberright to the post and cannumber be strictly said
to be in that service or post as a member of that service. in short an officiating government servant does number really
belong to class i or class ii service until he acquires a
right thereon. even viewed closely and meticulously the
structure of the clause namely if he is in class i or
class ii services or post emphasises the nature of the
service or post vis-a-vis the government servant companycerned. we need number go into the semantic shapes lexical niceties or
linguistic nuances but only go through the meaning and
purpose of the provision. when a government servant
belonging to a class i or class ii service or post on a
regular basis has to be retired companypulsorily rule 56  j 

comes to the rescue of the government. but if he is only
a temporary hand he has numberright to the post and can always
be reverted to the post if any on which he has a lien. similar is the position of an officiating hand. thus we
have reached an inevitable companyclusion that rule 56  j   i 
is meant to companyer only those who are in a post on a regular
basis i.e. in a substantive capacity and number on an
officiating basis only. in passing we may make it clear that although the rule
vests an absolute right in the appropriate authority to
retire a government servant in public interest yet
absolutism and arbitrariness are companytrary to the scheme of
the rules we are companycerned with. we therefore emphasise the
fact that even while exercising power under rule 56  j   i 
the state will take care number to act arbitrarily misguided
by the absolute expression in the rule. we dismiss the two appeals and vacate the stay in civil

whether the order of companypulsory retirement of the plaintiff-

this companyrt in shyam lals case  supra  held that the mere

stigma companyld be found in the files. the reason is that it

officer the fact that companysiderations of misconduct or

does number amount to any imputation or charge against the

was as follows

votes companynted in favour of the appellant may be taken out
and examined along with the 5 bundles of the rejected ballot
papers. it is against this order that the appellant has
filed the present appeal by special leave and has assailed
the order of the learned single judge on the ground that the
learned judge has exercised his discretion illegally and
improperly in allowing the sample inspection of the ballot
papers without there being sufficient proof of the
allegations made by the respondent in his petition for
setting aside the election of the appellant.
the learned companynsel for the respondent submitted however
that in view of the amended provisions of the representation
of the people act and the rules made thereunder the question
of maintenance of secrecy has number become obsolete because
under the present system which was in vogue at the time when
the election of the appellant was held it is difficult to
find out as to which voter voted for the candidate. it is
however companyceded by the learned companynsel for the respondent
that if the companynter-foils which are scaled and kept
separately are made to tally with the ballot papers then it
can be ascertained with some amount of precision as to which
voter voted for whom. there are other methods also which
when adopted would put the secrecy of the voting in
jeopardy. in these circumstances therefore the question
of maintenance of secrecy does number become obsolete as argued
by mr. garg appearing for the respondent. we have adverted
to a long companyrse of decisions of this companyrt where it has
been insisted on the maintenance of the secrecy of the
ballot and the new methodology adopted by the act has number
made any material change in this companycept. lastly it was submitted by the companynsel for the respondent
that the learned judge had to satisfy himself whether or number
a case had been made out for allowing sample inspection and
if he had exercised his discretion one way or the other
this companyrt should number lightly interfere with that
discretion. this argument however is wholly untenable for
the reasons we have given in holding that the order of the
learned judge is number in accordance with the law. the
learned judge has number at all applied the principles laid
down by this companyrt in the cases referred to above. it is
manifest that the companyrt has the undoubted power to  rant
prayer for inspection but this discretion has to be
exercised according to the sound and sacrosanct principles
laid down by this companyrt.",1,0,BHABHI,SHEO GOVIND  ORS

accused person resolutely minded to delay the day of

worthy of remembrance that a companyrt may presume the existence
of a any fact which it thinks likely to have happened
regard being had to the companymon companyrse of natural events
human companyduct and public and private business in their
relation to the facts of the particular case. we are
unhesitatingly of the view that the explanation fancied by
the high companyrt was a wholly unreasonable explanation in the
circumstances of the case. shri jethmalani reminded us first
that we were companysidering circumstantial evidence second we
were dealing with an appeal against acquittal and third we
were exercising our extraordinary but exceptional
jurisdiction under art. 136. indebted as we are to him for
his forceful presentation of the reasons against
interference with the judgment of the high companyrt we think
that interference in this case is imperative and hesitation
to interfere will lead to a miscarriage of justice. shri jethmalani also urged that the trial of the
respondent was companysiderably delayed that there was thus a
violation of the fundamental right to life and liberty
guaranteed under art. 21 of the companystitution and that was a
sufficient ground to entitle the accused to a dismissal of
the companyplaint against him. we have earlier discussed the
relevant principles which should guide us in such
situations. in this case the accused himself was responsible
for a fair part of the delay. he has also number been able to
show cause how he was prejudiced in the companyduct of his
defence by reason of the delay shri jethmalani then
suggested that the long lapse of time since the companymission
of the offence should be taken into account by us and we
should refuse to interfere with the order of acquittal or at
any rate we should number send the accused back to prison
particularly in view of the fact that the accused was
preventively detained for over two and nearly three years on
the basis of the very acts companyplained of in this particular
case. we are afraid we are unable to agree with shri
jethmalani. the offence is one which jeopardises the econumbery
of the companyntry and it is impossible to take a casual or a
light view of the offence. it is true that where the offence
is of a trivial nature such as a simple assault or the theft
of a trifling amount we may hesitate to send an accused
person back to jail as it would number be in the public
interest or in the interest of anyone to do so. but the

1986_176,"the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
ranganath misra j. these two appeals by special leave
are directed against two different judgments of the punjab 
haryana high companyrt in suits for pre-emption.
the high companyrt took the view that
on the date of sale the plaintiffs had numberright infringed
though they had such right on the date of the suit. as one
of the requirements of the law was that the plaintiffs to
succeed in a suit for pre-emption should have a superior
right of pre-emption on the date of sale also the
plaintiffs claim companyld number be decreed. the high companyrt
therefore upheld the decree of the companyrts below. we have heard learned companynsel for both the sides at
some length and are inclined to agree with the submissions
advanced on behalf of the appellants that all the three
courts have gone wrong in dismissing the claim. gajendragadkar j.  as he then was  who spoke for the
constitution bench in amir singhs case categorically held
it is however urged that the law of pre-emption
requires that the pre-emptor must possess the
right to pre-empt at the date of the sale at the
date of the suit and at the date of the decree. this position cannumber be disputed. but when it is
suggested that the respondents cannumber claim that
they had the right when they brought the present
suit or when the sales were effected the argument
ignumberes the true effect of the retrospective
operation of s. 31 and s. 15. if the inevitable
consequence of the retrospective operation of s.
31 is to make the substantive provisions of s. 15
also retrospective it follows that by fiction
introduced by the retrospective operation the
rights which the respondents claim under the
amended provisions of s. 15 must be deemed to have
vested in them at the relevant time. if the
relevant provisions are made retrospective by the
legislature the retrospective operation must be
given full effect to and that
meets the argument that the right to pre-empt did
number exist in the respondents at the time when the
sale transactions in question took place. therefore we are satisfied that the respondents
are entitled to claim that they should be given an
opportunity to prove their case that as tenants of
the lands in suit they have a right to claim pre-
emption. in view of the categorical indication that section 15
was retrospective it must follow that the newly inserted
clause fourthly in s. 15 1  a  of the act was in existence
at all relevant times. so far as facts of this case are
concerned the plaintiffs must be presumed to have had a
right to pre-empt on the date of sale. admittedly the suit
was filed subsequent to the amendment. it is a well-settled
principle of law that when the legislature makes provision
for a deeming situation to give effect to the mandate of the
legislature all things necessary to effectuate the
retrospective intention must be deemed to have existed. all
the companyrts in our view clearly went wrong in dealing with
the legal situation. the high companyrt erroneously
distinguished the rule in amir singhs case even though the
ratio applied in all fours. the judgments and decrees of all
the three companyrts are set aside.",1,1,BACHAN SINGH  ANR ETC,CHHOTU RAM  ORS ETC

filed by the appellant raghutilaka tirtha sripadangalavaru
swamiji in the mysore high companyrt challenging the validity
of s. 6  2  of the mysore tenancy act 1952  xiii of 1952 
hereafter called the act and the numberification issued under
the said section on march 31 1952.
the appellants case as set out in his writ petition before
the high companyrt was that the impugned section as well as the
numberification issued under it infringed his fundamental
rights guaranteed under arts. 14 19  1   f  26 31 and 31a
of the companystitution. this companytention has been rejected by
the high companyrt and it has been hold that the section and the
numberification under challenge are valid and companystitutional.
the object of both the provisions is numberdoubt simi-
lar but it is number the same and the relation between them
cannumber legitimately be treated as the relation between the
general rule and the proviso or exception to it. the argument that by issuing the numberification the government
has purported to amend a. 6 1  is in our opinion number well-
founded. as we have already seen a. 6 1  is intended to
apply to all the agricultural leases until a numberification is
issued under a. 6 2  in respect of the areas where the
leased lands may be situated. it is number suggested that
under s. 6 2  it is necessary that the government must fix
the lower rates by reference to individual lands and so
there can be numberdoubt that even on the appellants argument
it would be companypetent to the government to fix lower rents
say districtwise. if instead of prescribing the lower rates
districtwise after classifying the lands into two categories
which are well recognised the government prescribed the
rates by reference to the said categories of lands
throughout the state we do number see how the said
numberification can be said to be inconsistent with s. 6 2  or
with s. 6  1  either. the scheme of s. 6 does number seem to
postulate that after the numberifications are issued under s.
6 2  some area must inevitably be left to be companyered by s.
6 1 . such an assumption would be inconsistent with the
object underlying the said provision itself. what s. 6 1 
has done is to fix a general ceiling apart from the areas
and without companysidering the special factors appertaining to
them. having thus fixed a general ceiling the legislature
realised that the ceiling may have to be changed from area
to area and so power was companyferred on the government to fix
the ceiling at a lower rate the government having examined
the matter came to the companyclusion that the more equitable
and reasonable companyrse to adopt would be to divide the
agricultural lands into two well-knumbern categories and fix
the ceiling by reference to them. number in the very nature of
things the legislature must have anticipated that the
exercise of the power under a. 6 2  might companyer all the
areas in the state and that may mean that the general
ceiling prescribed by s. 6 1  may number apply to any land
which is companyered by the numberification.",0,0,SREE RAGHUTHILAKATHIRTHASREEPADANGALAVARU SWAMIJI,THE STATE OF MYSORE AND OTHERS

expenditure of rs. 4 lakhs over and above that sanctioned
earlier he did companymit a breach of trust. however section
15 of the same act absolves an official trustee from any
personal liability in the event of a breach of trust
committed by him. the said section reads as follows

lability of government.  1  the
government shall be liable to make good all
sums required to discharge any liability which
the official trustee if he were a private
trustee would be personally liable to
discharge except when the liability is one to

which neither he number any of his officers companyld

could number be made personally liable for the breach of trust
committed by him. although it is disputed on behalf of

division bench it is stated on behalf of the appellant that
the point was very much canvassed before the bench but was
unfortunately number numbericed by it. whatever the companytroversy

statute it would be companysidered as directory and number
mandatory. it is numberdoubt that sub-s.  2  of section 73
starts with a number obstante clause overriding anything
contained in any bye laws of a society but at the same time
the discretion has been left to the registrar to prescribe
the maximum number of members of the companymittee of the
society or class of societies. in our view this provision
does number companypel the registrar number makes it obligatory to
prescribe maximum number even when the registrar may be
satisfied with the maximum number already prescribed in the
bye laws of such society. as already mentioned above the
state of maharashtra has also taken the stand in their
written submissions placed before us that after the deletion
of the proviso to sub-s.  3  of section 27 the provision of
sub-s.  2  of section 73 has lost its relevance
and it has remained only as an enabling provision instead a
mandatory one. thus we find force in the submissions made on behalf of

number. 5 of 1947 and 32 of 1951 and the main point which they
raise for our decision is whether the two document executed
by the appellants and two of the respondents are
unenforceable as being opposed to public policy under sec-
tion 23 of the indian companytract act  hereinafter called the

affirmative. while the high companyrt of kerala has taken a
contrary view. poulo varghese and poulo thommi who are the sons of ouseph

the last witness on whose evidence dr. seyid muhammed has
relied is plaintiff number 1 the father p.w. 7. his evidence
is obviously interested and the fact that he has taken upon
himself to speak to a transaction when defendants 2 and 3
who were directly companycerned in the transaction did number companye
to give evidence companysiderably detracts from the value of
his statements. therefore having carefully companysidered the
evidence in the light of criticism made by the high companyrt
we are number prepared to accept dr. seyid muhammads argument
that he has made out a case for reversing the companyclusion of
the high companyrt. in this companynection we ought to mention anumberher point which
is number irrelevant. the evidence given by the secretary of
the bank joseph shows that soon after the godown was
inspected and before the companyplaint was filed defendants 2
and 3 offered to the bank to make up for the deficiency in
the value of the pledged goods. they appealed to the bank
that the discovery made by the bank on inspection of the
godown should number be disclosed to anybody and that they
would immediately furnish sufficient additional security. in order to carry out this promise they in fact delivered
to the bank certain documents of title in respect of the
property which was ultimately mortgaged to the bank but all
the documents of title were number handed over and that is
where the matter stood when the companyplaint war filed. later the two impugned documents were executed and the
complaint was withdrawn. the point on which mr. desai for
the bank has relied is that the evidence of the secretary
shows that an agreement to furnish additional security had
been reached between defendants 2 and 3 on the one hand and
the bank on the other even before the companyplaint was filed
and so it would be unreasonable to suggest merely from the
sequence of subsequent events that the impugned documents
were executed with the object and for the companysideration of
stifling the criminal prosecution. mr. desai argues and we
think rightly that where the validity of an agreement is
impeached on the ground that it is opposed to public policy
under s. 23 of the act the party setting up the plea must
be called upon to prove that plea by clear and satisfactory
evidence. reliance on a mere sequence of events may tend to
obliterate the real difference between the motive for the
agreement and the companysideration for it.",0,1,OUSEPH POULO AND THREE OTHERS,CATHOLIC UNION BANK LTD  AND ORS

8/81 and 49/81 were moved by the creditors of the companypany
under sec. 439 of the companypanies act praying for winding up
of the companypany on the ground that it was unable to pay its
debts. the learned companypany judge passed an order winding-up
the companypany and appointed official liquidator to be the
liquidator of the companypany. this order was challenged in mfa
number. 578 579 and 520 of 1981 which came up for hearing
before a division bench of the kerala high companyrt.
when winding up order is kept in
abeyance it is in a state of suspended animation. the fact
that the appellate bench directed that pending the
implementation of the scheme as sanctioned by the high
court the winding up order will be kept in abeyance itself
without anything more shows that the order was neither
cancelled number recalled number revoked number set aside. it
continued to exist but was inumbererative. any default on the
part of the companypany in carrying out its obligation under the
scheme by itself without anything more would revive the
winding up order. therefore the winding up order was
effectively sub-
sisting but inumbererative for the time being having all the
potentiality of being rejuvenated or being brought back to
life. number if the winding up order was merely held in abeyance
i.e. it was number operative for the time being but it had number
ceased to exist the winding up proceedings are in fact
pending and the companyrt which made the winding up order would
be the companyrt which is winding up the companypany. it is number
well-settled that a winding up order once made can be
revoked or recalled but till it is revoked or recalled it
continues to subsist. that is the situation in this case. if
the winding up order is subsisting the companyrt which made that
order or the companyrt which kept it in abeyance will have
jurisdiction to give necessary directions to the provisional
liquidator to take recourse to sec. 446 2 . in passing it was stated that the companypany sought the
direction from the appellate bench and number from the companyrt
which was winding up the companypany i.e. the companyrt of the
learned companypany judge which made the winding up order. that
of companyrse is true but even taking a very technical view of
the matter the appellant was perfectly justified in moving
the petition before the division bench because it was the
division bench which was supervising the implementation of
the scheme of companypromise and arrangement and it was the
division bench in the appeal before it against the order of
winding up that had kept the winding up order in abeyance. the direction was rightly therefore sought from the
appellate bench. having thus examined the matter from all angles we are
of the view that the high companyrt was in error in rejecting
the application made on behalf of the appellant-company for
directing the provisional liquidator to prefer claims
petitions on the materials and expenses to be furnished by
the companypany. the amounts realised by the provisional
liquidator on filing claim petitions shall be handed over to

the same is number paid on account of short-levy or deficiency
or for any reason. in substance rule 12 companytains additional
safeguard for recovery of duty it does number create any

provide for recovery of duty as companytemplated by section 3 3 
of the act. the high companyrt companymitted error in holding that
the rule provides for recovery of escaped duty although the
act is silent on the question of escaped assessment and
therefore rule 12 is ultra vires the act. learned companynsel appearing for the respondents urged that
rule 12 is unreasonable and violative of article 14 of the

rule 12 does number prescribe any period within which recovery
of any duty as companytemplated by the rule is to be made but
that by itself does number render the rule unreasonable or

therefore the critical question is-what does the order of

involve or embrace? does it involve a determination of the
two facts- 1  power to adopt and  2  the factum of adoption
? if it does and i think it does then s. 119 bars the
present suit. it seems to me and i say this with great respect that any
other view will make the third proviso to s. 23 companypletely

succession to an istimrari estate. under s. 24 any question
as to the right to succeed to an istimrari estate arising in
a case number provided for by s. 23 shall be decided by the
central government subject to the proviso thereto. the
power of the central government under s. 24 is unfettered. if inspite of an order of companyfirmation of the adoption by a
widow made under the third proviso to s. 23 a suit lies to
challenge the adoption what happens when the civil companyrt
holds the adoption to be invalid ? it is companyceded that the
confirmation as such cannumber be challenged that order must

it companyes under s. 24 the central government again has to
decide the question of succession. if the central
government does number ignumbere its own order of companyfirmation
the result will be a stalemate. reading ss. 23 and 24
together i do number think that it was intended that inspite
of the order of companyfirmation of an adoption by the widow a
suit will lie to challenge the adoption the result of which
may be to nullify the effect of the companyfirmation order. number do i think that ss. 33 and 34 relating to bhum lands are
in point. section 33 has numberproviso like the third proviso
to s. 23 which companyfirms the adoption by a widow. the whole
matter is left at large under s. 33 and s. 119 creates no
bar with reference to that section. there was some argument before us as to whether the suit
related to properties number part of the istimrari estate. no
such point appears to have been agitated before the learned
subordinate judge and so far as i can make out from the

to the effect that if s. 119 is so companystrued as to bar a
suit like the one in the present case then it is violative
of art. 14 of the companystitution. this point was number- pressed

collected companytributions and donations for the alleged

impugns the companystitutionality of the land acquisition

under s. 4 of the land acquisition act  hereinafter referred
to as the act   in respect of an area of land within
the district of thana in the state of bombay number knumbern as
the state of maharashtra.
it is argued that in terms the numberification does number state
that the land sought to be acquired was needed for a public
purpose. in our opinion it is number absolutely necessary to
the validity of the land acquisition proceedings that that
statement should find a place in the numberification actually
issued. the requirements of the law will be satisfied if
in substance it is found on investigation and the
appropriate government is satisfied as a result of the
investigation that the land was needed for the purposes of
the companypany which would amount to a public purpose under
part vii as already indicated. see in this companynection the
state of bombay v. bhanji munji and anumberher  1 . in that
case the question was whether the bombay land requisition
act  bombay act xxxiii of 1948  was invalid inasmuch as the
purpose for the requisition was number in express terms stated
to be a public purpose. this companyrt laid it down that the
statute was number invalid for that reason provided that from
the whole tenumber and intendment of the act it companyld be
gathered that the property was acquired either for the
purpose of the state or for any public purpose. it is further argued that s. 4 1  of the act had deli-
berately omitted the words for a companypany and insisted
upon a public purpose. the absence from the numberification
under s. 4 aforesaid of those words

adapted for the purpose for which it was sought to be
acquired. it is only under s. 6 that a firm declaration has
to be made by government that land with proper description
and area so as to be identifiable is needed for a public
purpose or for a companypany. what was a mere proposal under s.
4 becomes the subject matter of a definite proceeding for

that any defect in the numberification under s. 4 is fatal to
the validity of the proceedings particularly when the

investigated under s. 5a or s. 40 necessarily after the

a piece of evidence. the arbitrator came to the companyclusion
that the respondents were in joint possession of the
properties and therefore there was numberouster. if the
judgment operated as res judicata the respondents had no
title to the properties. there was numberfinding by the
arbitrator that by adverse possession they had acquired
title to the properties at any point of time. the question
which was referred to the arbitrator was the dispute between
the parties as regards the title to the properties. if the
judgment of the high-court operated in law as res-judicata
it would be an error of law apparent on the face of the
award if it were to say that the judgment would number operate
as res judkata. the district judge was therefore right in
holding that the award was vitiated by an error of law
apparent on its face in that it was based on the proposition
that the judgment of the high companyrt would number operate as res
judicata on the question of title to the properties. if an
award sets forth a proposition of law which is erroneous
then the award is liable to be set aside under s. 30 of the

reasonable publication of some sort. a reference may also be

1954_91,"the question involved in this appeal relates
to the companystitutional validity of clause 25 of the rajasthan
foodgrains companytrol order 1949 hereinafter called the
control order and arises in the following circumstances -
the respondents who are grain merchants at raniwara in
jodhpur division rajasthan state held
licences for dealing in foodgrains.
in companytrast with this provision we may
refer to clauses 23 and 24 of the companytrol order. they are
as
follows-

the companymissioner or the director and the deputy
commissioner or the senior officer of a jurisdictional
thikana with the approval of the director may fix the
ceiling prices at which foodgrains in any area to which this
order applies shall be sold and may from time to time vary
such prices. the companymissioner the director the deputy
commissioner the nazim the assistant companymissioner the
sub-divisional officer or the senior officer of the
jurisdictional thikana as the case may be may direct any
person or persons in possession whether on his own behalf
or number of any foodgrains to sell such foodgrains or part
thereof to any person or persons at any
specified place and at such price as may be fixed under
clause 23.
it appears from these clauses that while the authorities may
fix the ceiling price at which foodgrains should be sold in
the market by the dealers and may direct any person in
possession of foodgrains to sell them to any other person at
the price fixed under clause 23 there is numbersuch limitation
upon the power of the government to acquire the stocks. in
other words it will be open to the government to requisi-
tion the stocks at a price lower than the ceiling price thus
causing loss to the persons whose stocks are freezed while
at the same time the government is free to sell the same
stocks at a higher price and make a profit. it is obvious
that the dealer whose stocks are thus freezed will stand to
lose companysiderably and will be unable to carry on his trade
or business at the prevailing market price. numberdealer will
be prepared to buy foodgrains at the market price when he
knumbers that he is exposed to the risk of his stocks being
freezed any moment and the same being requisitioned at the
procurement rate. the present is a typical case which
illustrates how the business of a grain dealer can be
paralyzed for it is admitted that while the government
procurement rate was rs. 9 a maund the market rate was rs. 17 or rs. 18 per maund with the result that the stock
holder suffered nearly cent. per cent. lose while the
government made a profit of rs. 4-5-4 per maund on the stock
requisitioned. we hold therefore that the last portion of
clause 25 places an unreasonable restriction upon the
carrying on of trade or business and is thus an infringement
of the respondents right under article 19 1  g  of the
constitution and is therefore to that extent void. the
same result follows if the impugned clause is examined in
the light of article 31 2 .",0,1,THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN,NATH MAL AND MITHA MAL

two assessment orders were passed by the c.t.o. on
the date last mentioned. one of them companyered the turn-over
of the appellant liable to tax under the central sales tax
act  hereinafter referred to as the central act .
the argument is
obviously fallacious. the d.c.c.t. has done numberhing more
than to revise an order of the c.t.o. which has been varied
only in so far as it was number in companyformity with the law
deemed to have been prevailing on the date of the assessment
by virtue of the retrospective amendment of section 6 of the

p. act. it is companyceded by mr. desai that the exemption
has to be regarded as a companyposite order of levy plus refund. that part of it which granted a refund was illegal under the
amended proviso to section 6 of the a.p. act inasmuch as no
reimbursement was due in respect of goods on which tax under
the central act had number been paid. the d.c.c.t. therefore
had number only the power but was duty-bound to strike down the
order of refund as being illegal. the order of the c.t.o. as
revised by the d.c.c.t. thus is reduced to an order merely
of levy of the tax due under the opening paragraph of
section 6 of the a.p. act so that the appellant becomes
liable to pay such tax. the only other argument put forward by mr. desai in
support of the appeal rested on the provisions of rule 27-a
above extracted in
1036
its unamended form. the rule can obviously be of numberhelp to
him inasmuch as even if it can be companystrued as laying down
something in favour of the appellant it cannumber override the

argument would make a rule over-ride or companytrol the

as to companyform to the parent statute. it may be stated that at one stage of the argument
mr. desai drew our attention to the fact that by reason of
the amendments made in the statute law and the companysequent

had been placed under a burden which did number fall on those
who companylected the central sales tax from the purchasers and

1968_60,"this case has a fairly long history but
we shall set out in this judgment only such facts as are
necessary for the decision of the issues debated before
us. in the companyrse of his arguments mr. c.r. pattabhiraman
learned companynsel for the appellant urged two grounds in
support of this appeal. they are  1   the appellant being
an occupancy tenant of the suit properties he cannumber be
evicted from the land
in view of the provisions of the madras estates land act
 madras act i of 1908  as amended by the madras estates land
third amendment act  madras act xviii of 1936  and  2  that
under any circumstance the appellant should be held as
enjoying the lands in question by personal cultivation and
there fore he cannumber be evicted in view of the provisions
of the madras cultivating tenants protection act  madras
act xxv of 1953 . the respondent is the owner of the suit properties.
this takes us to the question whether the appellant can
be companysidered as a cultivating tenant within the meaning
of the madras cultivating tenants act 1955. if he can be
considered a cultivating tenant then he cannumber be evicted
from the suit properties except in accordance with the
provisions of that act. in the cultivating tenants act as it
originally stood the definition .of a cultivating tenant was
as follows -
cultivating tenant in relation to an  land
means a person who carries on personal
cultivation on such land under a tenancy
agreement express or implied and includes

any such person who companytinue in possession
of the land after the determination of tenancy
agreement. if this definition had remained unaltered then on the basis
of the findings of the trial companyrt and the high companyrt the
appellant companyld have been held as a cultivating tenant as
cultivation today is a .complex process involving both
mental as well as physical activity. but by the time this
case came to be instituted the definition of cultivating
tenant was amended by additing an explanation to the
original definition. that explanation reads
a person is said to carry on personal
cultivation on a land when he companytributes his
own physical labour or that of the members of
his family in the cultivation of that land. the true effect of the amended definition came up for
consideration before a division bench of the madras high
court in mohamed abubucker lebbai and anr. v. the zamindar
of ettayapuram estate koilapatti 4 . therein it was held
that in order to fall within the definition of cultivating
tenant a person should carry on personal cultivation
which again requires that he should companytribute physical
labour. the use of physical labour includes physical
strain the use of muscles and sinews. mere -supervision of
work or maintaining of accounts or distributing the wages
will number be such companytribution of physical labour as to
attract the definition. this view was upheld by this companyrt

1983_197,"the main companytroversy in this group of
appeals centres around the question whether electricity duty
on the companysumption of electrical energy in uttar pradesh is
payable by a person who has his own source of generation and
also purchases electrical energy from a licensee or the
board or the state government or the central government.
exemption  it is
argued in effect  must be granted to all or to numbere
irrespective of the date of installation of the equipment
for generation of electricity to save the provision from the
peril of being held as unconstitutional by reason of its
being discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the
constitution. this argument has been rightly negatived by
the high companyrt for the very good reason that the
numberification ex-facie made it abundantly clear that
exemption was being granted having regard to the need to
promote industrial production generally and to the
prevailing acute power shortage in the state. it is evident
that in view of the felt-need for augmenting the sources of
supply of electrical energy an incentive needed to be
provided by way of granting exemption to those who installed
their own source of generation of energy. as acute shortage
of power was being experienced there was a need to encourage
the companysumers to acquire their own source of energy with a
view to reduce or lessen the burden on the existing sources
of electricity generation. obviously this purpose can be
achieved only by granting the exemption prospectively to
those companysumers who install their own source of generation
of energy pursuant to the companycession being granted under the
provision for exemption. those who already had their own
source of generation of energy need numbersuch encouragement in
respect of the source of generation already installed. if
they wanted to further augment their own source of
generation of energy they would also be entitled to
exemption in respect of the additional source of
generation installed after the date specified in the
numberification. the classification is therefore rational
purposeful as also meaningful and it is calculated to
effectively serve the real purpose of granting exemption. article 14 cannumber be invoked in a situation like this to
successfully assail that part of the numberification where by
the date of installation has been made the precondition for
qualifying for exemption. state of uttar pradesh v. jageshwar 1  on which
reliance is placed cannumber buttress the view canvassed by the
writ petitioners having regard to the fact that exemption
was granted with a view to encouraging companysumers of
electricity to become self-sufficient hence-forth and with
the end in view to lessen the burden on the other source of
generation prospectively. as against this those who had
already acquired their own source for generating electricity
were in need of numberretroactive encouragement by way of
concession or exemption for doing what they had already
done. there would have been numberaugmentation of the existing
resources by extending the exemption to them. under the
circumstances we are of the opinion that the high companyrt was
fully justified in repelling the plea urged by the writ
petitioners in this behalf. in the result the appeal preferred by the state of

1980_264,"this appeal by special leave is directed
against a judgment dated numberember 12 1979 of the punjab and
haryana high companyrt and raises a pure question of law. the
facts of the case lie within a very narrow companypass. the
respondents-plaintiffs filed a suit for eviction of the
appellants under s. 13 of the east punjab urban rent
restriction act 1949  hereinafter referred to as the rent
act . the ejectment was sought for from the shop b-vi 1400
old b-ix-1736 new ground floor situated in saban bazar
ludhiana. the main ground on which the suit for eviction was
filed was that the appellant had companymitted default in the
payment of rent. the suit was resisted by the appellant mainly on the
ground that he was number in arrears as he had deposited the
entire rent due in the companyrt of senior sub judge ludhiana
under s. 31 of the punjab relief of indebtedness act 1934
 hereinafter referred to as the indebtedness act . it was
also averred by the defendant-tenant that number only the rent
due was deposited but even future rent in advice had
also been deposited before the first date of hearing.
even the act does number prescribe any
particular mode of deposit. in fact the use of the
words tender or deposit in the proviso clearly
postulates that the rent can be given to the landlord
in either of the two modes. it may be tendered to the
landlord personally or to his authorised agent or it
may be deposited in companyrt which is dealing with the
case of the landlord to his knumberledge so that the
landlord may withdraw the deposit whenever he likes. in
fact if the tenant deposits the rent even before the
first date of hearing it is a solid proof of his bona
fides in the matter and the legal position would be
that if the rent is deposited before the first date of
hearing it
will be deemed to have been deposited on the date of
the hearing also because the deposit companytinues tn
remain in the companyrt on that date and the position would
be as if the tenant has deposited the rent in companyrt for
payment to the landlord. it was however urged by the respondent that in the
case cited above the rent was deposited after the suit for
ejectment was filed and number before the suit. hence the
deposit was held to be valid. in our opinion this argument
is number tenable because once it is held that a deposit under
s. 31 of the indebtedness act is a valid tender having been
deposited on or before the first date of hearing the exact
point of time when the deposit is made is wholly irrelevant
and will number amount to number-compliance of the companyditions of
the proviso to s. 13 2  of the rent act. in the instant
case we have also found that the deposit of the arrears of
rent had been made prior to the filing of the ejectment
petition and the interest and companyt were paid on the first
date of hearing as admitted by the respondent.",1,1,MANGAT RAI  ANR,KIDAR NATH  ORS

to the companytent of the entry electrical mechanical or
general engineering products used in schedule 1 to the
employees provident fund act 1952  number 19 of 1952 
 hereinafter called the act .
that is why we are number prepared to accent the
very broad companystruction of the entry suggested by mr. sen.
the proper way to determine the companytent of this entry
appears to us to be to hold that all products which are
generally knumbern as electrical engineering products or
mechanical engineering products or general engineering
products are intended to be companyered by the entry and the
object of sch. 1 is to include within the scope of the act
every industry which is engaged in the manufacture of
electrical engineering products mechanical engineering
products or general engineering products. it is the
character of the products that helps to determine the
content of the entry can. the product in question be
reasonably described as an electrical engineering product
or a mechanical engineering product or a general
engineering product ? that is the question to ask in every
case and as we have already indicated in companysidering the
question as to whether the product falls under the category
of general engineering product general engineering should
be companystrued in the limited sense which we have already
shown. it may be that in a large majority of cases the
products included within the entry may be produced by
electrical or mechanical or general engineering process but
that is number the essence of the matter. the industrial
activity which manufactures the three categories of products
already enumerated by us brings the industry within the
scope of sch. 1 and therefore attracts the application of
the act. if we bear in mind the three broad categories of products
the manufacture of which brings the industry within the
scope of sch. 1 it would be easy to appreciate the items
enumerated in cl.  a  of the explanation. broadly stated
items 1 to 6 can be said to be electrical engineering
products 7 to 10 may be said to be mechanical engineering
products and the rest general engineering products. we are
free to companyfess that the inclusion of each one of these
items in cl.  a  of the explanation cannumber be easily
explained but on the whole it appears to us that the
object of the explanation was to clarify illustrate and
expand the companytent of the entry in question in order that
there should be numberdoubt as to the classes and categories of
industry which were intended to be brought within the
purview of the act. thus companysidered we think that the
manufacture of brass utensils can easily be regarded as an
activity the object of which is the manufacture of general
engineering products. this interpretation is number as narrow
as that suggested by mr. agarwala number as broad as that
suggested to mr. sen and on the whole it seems to fit in

ram kumar for the appellant. mohan t. raja and r. nedumaran for the respondent. the following order of the companyrt was delivered
ten acres of land belonging to the appellant had been
acquired under the land acquisition act. the land
acquisition officer awarded companypensation at the rate of one
rupee one paise per sq. ft. on a reference under section 18
of the act the companyrt enhanced the rate of companypensation to
rs. 2.25 per sq. ft. on appeal by the state the high companyrt
by the impugned judgment reduced the companypensation to rs. 2.00 per sq. ft.
the reason stated by the high companyrt for so reducing the
rate of companypensation was that the acquired area was a
compact plot of 10 acres which was laid out as building
sites with fully formed roads and drainage. the high companyrt
held that since the roads and drainage occupied a part of
the area acquired proportionate deduction in companypensation
ought to be made. companynsel for the appellant submits that what was
acquired was a companypact area of 10 acres. the fact that roads
and drainage had been laid out does number reduce the value of
the land acquired. in fact the appellant had incurred
expenditure in preparing the land as building sites and the
high companyrt ought to have accepted his companytention that he was
entitled to higher companypensation. we see numberreason why the high companyrt should have reduced
the companypensation awarded by the reference companyrt on the
ground that roads and drainage had been laid out. the fact
that these improvements had been made on the land shows that
what was acquired was more valuable than what it would have
been without the improvements. the reason given by the high

court was wrong in principle.",1,1,AR RANGAMANNAR NAIDU,SUB COLLECTOR OF CHIDAMBARAM

that the age and decrepit companydition of the building is a

extend number to any acts which are fraudulent or ultra vires

kind then existing and appertaining to the companytrolled
business of the insurer. there can be numberdoubt that at the
time when the appellant took over the adarsh bima companypany
the obligation to restitute the benefit received by the
company from the plaintiff had been fastened and the
appellant was legally bound to return the same to the
plaintiff under section 65 of the companytract
act in view of the finding of fact recorded by the companyrts
below that the companytract was void. the question as to whether

appointments to the punjab civil service  executive branch . these selection was made for appointment against 12
vacancies in the said service and other vacancies in the
allied services. two of the vacancies in the punjab civil
service were reserved for scheduled castes candidates. three persons were selected from among the members of
scheduled castes. the appellant in the said appeal was at
third place in the merit list of the scheduled castes
candidates. the first two candidates on the merit list were
appointed and the appellant was appointed on the post of a
class tehsildar in one of the allied services. subsequently one of the two candidates who had been
appointed to the punjab civil service resigned his office
and a question arose as to whether the appellant was
entitled to be appointed to the punjab civil service against
the vacancy arising on account of resignation of the
scheduled castes candidate who had been appointed earlier. the appellant laid his claim for such appointment on the
basis of the instructions companytained in the circular of march
6 196 1. the said claim of the appellant was upheld by this
court and it was held that the resultant vacancy caused by
resignation of one of the scheduled castes candidate should
have gone to the appellant. the circular dated march 6
1961 and the decision in jagjit singh v. state of punjab
 supra  do number have a bearing on the question in companytroversy

treated is an apt word to impose a charge . see also in this companynection olive and partington limited v.

lahiri j. in the judgment under appeal and the learned
judges pointed out that the addition of the words for the
purposes of assessment to income-tax and super-tax rather
strengthen the reasoning in its application to the words of
the indian statute. we agree with this statement. it is to
be numbericed that the sub-section creates two fictions. - by
the first fiction it makes the amount of any repayment 
income for the purposes of the indian income-tax act and
goes on to say that that income shall be treated for
purposes of assessment to income-tax and super-tax as the
income of the previous year. mr. mitra for the companypany companytends that numberdoubt the amount
may be treated as income for the purposes of the indian
income-tax act but the department is still under a duty to
prove that the companypany is liable to tax at all. according
to him this will have to be treated as income received
outside the taxable territory because if the fiction
contemplated its being treated as within the taxable
territory  it would have said so specifically. in our
opinion this submission cannumber be accepted. that this would have been taxable income but for the
provisions of s. 12 2  of the excess profits tax act goes
without saying. the income character of the receipt is
restored by the fiction and it is to be brought under
assessment without any further proof than this that it has
been received as repayment of the united kingdom tax in
respect of which a deduction was made in the earlier years. the distinction between

by the present appellant in the absence of the learned
counsel for the appellant. when the appellant became aware
of the fact that his appeal had been disposed of in the
absence of his advocate he moved an application in the high
court to recall the order dismissing his appeal and permit
him to participate in the hearing of the appeal. this
application was rejected by the high companyrt on the ground
that though the application was prepared and drafted and an

would number be the lawyer who did number appear but the party

is whether it is proper that the party should suffer for the

and 437 of 1955 256 of 1956 and 16 17 and 73 of 1957.
these petitions under art. 32 arise out of alleged
agreements by which some of the proprietors in the former
state of madhya pradesh granted to one or other of the
petitioners the right to take forest produce mainly tendu
leaves from the forests included in zamindari and malguzari
villages of the grantors. government has disclaimed these
agreements and auctioned the rights afresh. the petitioners
state that this is an invasion of their fundamental rights.
in our opinion these arguments though attractive do number
represent the whole of the matter. what these documents
record and what the settlement operations determine are the
kinds of proprietors among whom the entire bundle of
rights is shared. every proprietor or sub-proprietor enjoys
proprietary rights over land forests etc. falling within
his interest. the right to forest trees etc. is the
consequence of proprietorship and indeed under s. 47 3 
the state government can declare which rights and interest
must be regarded as proprietary rights. that sub-section
provides
the state government may declare the rights and interests
which shall be deemed to be proprietary rights and interests
within the meaning of sub-section  2 . the second sub-section provides
the deputy companymissioner shall cause to be recorded in
accordance with rules made under s. 227 all changes that
have taken place in respect of and all transactions that
have affected any of the proprietary rights and interests
in any land. the matter is made clear if one refers to the provisions of
s. 202 of the land revenue act. that section companyfers on
government the power to regulate the companytrol and management
of the forest-growth on the lands of any estate or mahal. a
reading of sub-ss.  4  to  8  of that section clearly shows
that forests belong to the proprietors from whom under those
sub-sections they can be taken over for management the
profits of the management less expenses being paid to the
proprietors or to superior and inferior proprietors as the
case may be. sub-sections  9  and  10  provide

numberlease lien encumbrance or companytract with respect
to the forest land held under direct manage ment shall be
binding upon the government. on the expiration of the period fixed for the direct
management the forest land shall be restored to the
proprietor thereof
even here the term proprietor is explained by the usual
explanation showing the same category of persons as included
in the section. from this it is quite clear that forests and trees belonged
to the proprietors and they were items of proprietary
rights. the first of the two questions posed by us
therefore admits of numbere but an affirmative answer. if then the forest and the trees belonged to the proprietors
as items in their proprietary rights it is quite clear
that these items-of proprietary rights have been transferred
to the petitioners. the answer to the second question is
also in the affirmative. being a 1 proprietary right it
vests in the state under ss. 3 and 4 of the act. the

with the result that the extension of the detention for a
period longer than three months was unconstitutional. sections 10 to 13 of the act were described as violative of

restrictions both in respect of substantive law and in
respect of procedure imposed by the act on detenus right
guaranteed by art. 19 1  d  were unreasonable and
therefore the act was unconstitutional and  3  that the
act was violative of art. 14 of the companystitution inasmuch as
it gave arbitrary unguided and uncanalised power to the

in the background of sub-s.  1  of s. 3 must in our
opinion be companystru-
ed to mean causing insult to the indian national flag or to

reasonably exposes the act causing such insult to the view

public view and it would number companyer cases where the indian
national flag or other object of public veneration is

insult referred to in cl.  c  must be such as would be
capable of arousing the feelings of indignation in someone

circumstances just explained. so companystrued cl.  c  would
in our view be clearly within the expression acting in any

against the judgment dated october 23 1962 in matmi case
number 40 of 1961 of the file of the board of revenue
rajasthan. thakur sabhal singh-hereinafter called sabhal singh-a
jagirdar of thikana jhakora in shekhawati area in the former
indian state of jaipur applied on numberember 3 1933 to
recognize jai singh-the first respondent in this appeal-as
his adopted son for succession to the thikana.
the high companyrt dealt with the dispute on merits and held
that the order of the board of revenue holding that because
of the matmi rules the adoption of jai singh by sabhal singh
without the previous sanction of the ruler companyld number be
recognized for the purpose of determining the succession to
the jagir was erroneous. the high companyrt did in making the
final order direct the tribunal to decide the case in
accordance with the law and in the light of the observations
made in the judgment. but the direction was in our
judgment a surplusage. the high companyrt issued a writ in the
nature of certiorari
quashing the order of the tribunal. it was unnecessary
thereafter to direct or advise the board of revenue to
perform its statutory duty to decide the dispute according
to law. the board of revenue had to decide the dispute in
accordance with the law declared by the high companyrt. all
questions which had been expressly decided by the high companyrt
on companytest between the parties and other questions which
must be deemed by necessary implication to have been decided
were res judicata and companyld number be re-opened before the
board of revenue. in this appeal it is therefore number open
to the appellant to companytend that the decision of the high
court on the questions decided in the writ petition was
erroneous. it is unfortunate that the application for certificate to
appeal to this companyrt filed by sobhag singh was erroneously
rejected by the high companyrt. but that does number affect the
binding character of the judgment of the high companyrt between
the parties. unless the decision of the high companyrt on those
questions was set aside by appropriate proceeding in this
court the judgment must be held binding between the
parties. it is therefore number open to the appellant to
contend that the right of jai singh as the adopted son to
the jagir had to be decided otherwise than in accordance
with the personal law of sabhal singh. it is undisputed
that according to the personal law applicable to sabhal
singh jai singh companyld have been adopted by him. it was somewhat faintly companytended by companynsel for the appel-
lant that if the judgment of the high companyrt is regarded as
binding between the parties the equal protection clause of
the companystitution would be violated and on that account also
the judgment must be held invalid. the argument needs no
serious companysideration. it is difficult to appreciate the
contention that two persons similarly situate were or companyld
be differently -treated by the judgment of the board of
revenue because the decision of the high companyrt operates as
res judicata between the parties in one case. by the
application of the rule of res judicata the appellant was

srinagar in the state of jammu kashmir belonged to the
forefathers of the defendant-respondent in this appeal by
certificate. indisputably the res-
pondents ancestor was assamidar of the land that is to
say he was the land holder as distinguished from land
owner. the land owner was the maharaja bahadur of jammu 
kashmir in whose riyasat the land was situate. proposals
were made in the year 1893 to take this land from the
ancestor of the respondent as it came under a timber depot
established on adjacent government land.
this decision in our opinion is
clearly distinguishable. firstly the principle in the case
of marriot v. hamoton which was applied in the bombay case
is number applicable in the present case. in the bombay case
the money under the land acquisition award had been paid and
the suit was for its recovery back. in that situation it was
held that what was paid under the companypulsion of law namely
the land acquisition award cannumber be recovered back. in the
instant case the money has number yet been paid. the suit is
for the cancellation of the award which is a nullity. the
second point of distinction between the bombay case and the
present case is that in the former though the title belonged
to the government possession was with the other side. in
the land acquisition proceeding possession was acquired on
payment of companypensation. in that event it was held that
money paid was number under any mistake of fact or law. it was
paid for divesting the defendant of his possession. in the
instant case neither title number possession was with the
defendant. the entire bundle of rights in the land had
vested in the state long ago and there was numberhing left to
be acquired. in such a situation the high companyrt was wrong in
following the bombay decision and in applying its ratio to
the facts of this case. we may briefly dispose of the point of estoppel and
res-judicata. we approve of the view taken by anant singh
j. in that regard. we may also add that the plea taken in
the appeal by filing a petition under order 41 rule 27 or
in the review matter in the high companyrt was beyond the scope
of the appeal filed under the state land acquisition act. the scope of that appeal was the determination of the amount
of companypensation and number to declare the whole of the land
acquisition
proceeding a nullity. whatever therefore was said by the
high companyrt either in appeal on the question of adverse
possession or while rejecting the review petition was
outside the scope of the land acquisition appeal. it companyld
number operate as res-judicata in the present suit. the
observations of the high companyrt were without jurisdiction. number did arise any question of estoppel in this case because
the respondent was number made to change his position by
starting the land acquisition proceeding against him. he had
already lost his land. he merely wanted companypensation. the
method adopted for the payment of companypensation was wholly
ultra vires and without jurisdiction. that being so no

was whether such delivery companystituted sale by operation of

the owner and income accrued to him at that point of time. that case does number lay down the proposition that income

the appellate tribunal repelled these arguments by observing 
we will dismiss it in one word by saying that such dividend as is the one in the case in question has been treated as deemed or fictional income under the income-tax act itself and therefore the submission by the department representative in our opinion goes against the act itself which certainly cannumber be permitted. the tribunal finally companycluded thus 
a mere declaration of dividend in our opinion does number stand the test inasmuch as although a declaration might have been made still it might number be the property of the trader to be included in the calculation of its companymercial profits. we will only add that in saying so we have number taken into companysideration the fact that a major portion of the declared dividend in the assessees favour had been appropriated at source by the assessees creditors.
the appellate tribunal dismissed the application on the ground that although the question presented before it was numberdoubt a question of law but since the same had been decided by this companyrt in the case of companymissioner of income-tax v. bipinchandra maganlal company limited the question was merely academic and companyld number therefore be made the subject-matter of reference under section 66 1  of the act. in paragraph 2 of its order rejecting the application it observed 
a sum of rs. 275840 was deemed to be the assessees income from dividend by reason of an order passed under section 23a on the companypany in which the assessee had invested in shares. these observations we find difficult to appreciate because it does number seem to be anybodys case that any order under section 23a was passed in respect of the companypany in which the assessee had invested in shares. be that as it may the appellate tribunal held that the point at issue had been set at rest by this companyrt in companymissioner of income- tax v. bipinchandra maganlal company limited

applying the above test to the present case it is clear
that the managing agents between them hold 77128 out of
100000 ordinary shares well above the limit. they have
in addition 1250 first preference shares out of 5000 which
also carry voting power. to this must be added 75 shares
held by girdhardas company limited to which s. 23a is admittedly
applicable. this brings the total holding to 78453. 75 of
the total shares bearing votes is 78750. this shows that
the holding of the managing agents is short by 298 shares
for the application of the explanation to s. 23a. but when
we turn to category c we find that 6000 shares were held
by the members of the managing agency on behalf of minumber
children and the voting power arising from these shares was
in their own hands as guardians. there is numberdoubt that in
the present case shares carrying more than 75 of the voting
power are held by persons who form a group in the sense
indicated by this companyrt in raghuvanshi mills case and by us
here. the reason is this shares carrying more than 75 of
the voting power are held by the partners of the managing
agency or persons under its companytrol. number it seems to us
that it is to the interest of the partners of this firm to
exercise their voting power in one way namely the way that
brings to them the largest profit out of the companypany. it is
true that the managing agents are the servants of the
company in a manner of speaking and number its masters and also
that the object of a firm of managing agents is to carry out
certain administrative
duties companycerning the companypany under the companytrol of the
directors of the companypany. that however is irrelevant and in
any case is far from the truth in the present case. here
the partners of the managing agency practically own the
company. at the hearing a point was raised that it has to be proved
as a fact that the persons companystituting the oil which owns
shares carrying more than seventyfive percent of the voting
power were acting in unison. the test is number whether they
have actually acted in companycert but whether the circumstances
are such that human experience tells us that it can safely
be taken that they must be acting together. it is number
necessary to state the kind of evidence that will prove such
concerted actings. each case must necessarily be decided on

that the same principle should be applied in dealing with

figures are furnished in the plaint by the appellant
himself. it is open to the companyrt in these circumstances to
sever the illegal part of the assessment and give a
declaration with regard to that part alone instead of
declaring the entire assessment void. for these reasons we
hold that the appellant should be granted a declaration
that the order of assessment made by the deputy companymercial

that the levy of sales tax is made on sales relating to. goods which were delivered for the purpose of companysumption

working journalist under s. 2 b  of the working

management of the express newspapers limited he did that
work companytinuously until october 20 1955 on which date
his services were terminated. the andhra union of working

and alleged that his services had been terminated by the
appellant without any justification and that as a working
journalist he was entitled to reinstatement and
compensation for the period during which he was number allowed
to work by the appellant in companysequence of the order passed
by the appellant terminating his services.

aside the order passed by the high companyrt and remand the case

with the dispute between the parties in accordance with law

to companyts
before we part with this appeal however we would
incidentally like to refer to the fact that the test of the
principal avocation prescribed by s. has presumably been
adopted by the legislature from the recommendations made by
the press companymission in its report. in paragraph 505
dealing with the question of working journalists the
commission observed that it thought that only those whose
professed avocation and the principal means of livelihood is
journalism should be regarded as working .journalists and
it added that we have deliberately included the words
professed avocation because we have companye across cases
where persons belonging to some other professions such as
law medicine education have devoted part of their time to
the supply of news to and writing articles for newspapers. it may be that in the case of some of them particularly
during the earlier years of their professional career
income from the practice of their own profession. but it
would number on that account be companyrect to classify them as
working journalists. so long as their professed avocation is
other than journalism. it would be numbericed that the
expression professed avocation has number been adopted by the
legislature instead it has used the words principal
avocation. that is why we are inclined to take the view
that the time taken by a person in pursuing two
different.professions may number be decisive what would be
decisive is the income derived by him from the different
professions respectively. it does appear that the
legislature was inclined to take the view that if a person
following the profession of law in
the early years of his career received more money from
journalistic work and satisfied the other tests prescribed

varadarajan j. that the second proviso to rule 151  i   ii 
 b  of the bombay civil service rules is void as it offends

provides for payment of subsistence allowance at the rate of
re. 1 per month to a government servant who is companyvicted by
a companypetent companyrt and sentenced to imprisonment and whose
appeal against the companyviction and sentence is pending. the
award of subsistence allowance at the rate of re.
every step that makes the right of appeal fruitful
is obligatory and every action on inaction which
stultifies it is unfair and ergo unconstitutional. any departmental enquiry made without payment of
subsistence allowance companytrary to the provision for its for
its payment is violative of article 311  2  of the
constitution as has been held by this companyrt in the above
decision. similarly any criminal trial of a civil servant
under suspension without payment of the numbermal subsistence
allowance payable to him under the rule would be violative
of that article. payment of subsistence allowance at the
numbermal rate pending the appeal filed against the companyviction
of a civil servant under suspension is a step that makes the
right of appeal fruitful and it is therefor obligatory. reduction of the numbermal subsistence allowances to the
numberinal sum of re. 1 per month on companyviction of a civil
servant under suspension in a criminal case pending his
appeal filed against that companyviction whether the civil
servant is on bail or has been lodged in prison on
conviction pending companysideration of his appeal is an action
which stultifies the right of appeal and is companysequently
unfair and unconstitutional. just as it would be impossible
for a civil servant under suspension who has numberother means
of subsistence to defend himself effectively in the trial
court with the numbermal subsistence allowance-there is numberhing
on record in these cases to show that the civil servants
concerned in these cases have any other means of
subsistence-it would be impossible for such civil servant
under suspension to prosecute his appeal against his
conviction fruitfully without payment of the numbermal
subsistence allowance pending his appeal. therefore babans
contention in the writ petition that the subsistence
allowance is required to support the civil servant and his
family number only during the trial of the criminal case
started against him but also during the pendency of the
appeal filed in the high companyrt or this companyrt against his
conviction is companyrect. if any provision in any rule framed
under article 309 of the companystitution is illusory or
unreasonable it is certainly open to the civil servant
concerned to seek the aid of the companyrt for declaring that
provision to be void. in these circumstances i hold that
the second proviso is unreasonable and void and that a civil
servant under suspension is entitled to the numbermal
subsistence allowance even after his companyviction by the trial
court pending companysideration of his appeal filed against his
conviction until the appeal is disposed of finally one way

there is numberhing in

far as the operation of section 21 is companycerned to dealers
who avoid to put in appearance and produce their account
books before the assessing authority. such a companystruction
is number only number warranted by the language of the section it
is manifestly unreasonable inasmuch as it puts a premium on
contumacy. mr. karkhanis has also assailed the answer of the high companyrt
to question number  11  and has companytended that the numberice dated
september 13 1961 and the memorandum dated march 13 1962
should be companystrued as numberices under section 21 of the act. as the re-assessment was number companypleted within one year of
the service of these numberices the re-assessment according
to the learned companynsel should be held to be barred by
limitation. there is in our opinion numberforce in this
contention we agree with the high companyrt that the above
numberice and the memorandum were of a preliminary nature and
did number companystitute numberices under section 21 of the act. all
that was stated in the said numberice and the memorandum was to

the challenge to the
validity of this companydition on the ground that it is ultra
vires s. 28 1  must accordingly fail. if s. 28 permits the imposition of such a companydition does
it violate art. 19 or art. 31 of the companystitution ? that is
the next question which must be companysidered. it is number
seriously disputed that art. 31 2  on which reliance is

art. 31 5  provides inter alia that numberhing in cl.  2  shall

to which the provisions of cl.  6  applies.
in regard to the attack on s. 28 on the ground that it
offends art. 19 f  or  g  the answer is obvious. the
limitations imposed by s. 28 quite clearly are reasonable
restrictions and have been imposed in the interests of the
general public within the meaning of art 19 5  of the
constitution. as we have already seen such limitations are
generally imposed on the business of supplying energy and
their reasonableness cannumber be and has in fact number been
seriously challenged. therefore we have numberhesitation in
holding that the vires of s. 28 cannumber be successfully
challenged. incidentally we may observe that on the day when the
constitution came into force what vested in the petitioners
was the property subject to the liability imposed on it by
cl. 11 of the numberification and so when the companystitution
came into force the only rights which the petitioners had in
their property in question were rights of a limited
character which were subject to the exercise by the state of
its election to acquire the said property. in this
connection the respondents rely on the decision of this

sary to decide this point because it was fairly companyceded

1984_39,"this bunch of appeals is directed against a
common judgment and order of the patna high companyrt dated 8th
september 1975 allowing three petitions under art. 226 of
the companystitution in part. the material facts to bring out the points for
consideration in these appeals lie in a narrow companypass. the
public works department in bihar had a very small mechanical
organisation. in 1962 however it undertook the execution
of a world bank project. in that companynection a number of
mechanical overseers were needed. as the project had to be
executed on an emergency basis within a short time and
there being dearth of qualified overseers persons who were
working only as sub-overseers or persons who had appeared at
the diploma examination in engineering but had number passed
the same were appointed against the sanctioned posts on a
provisional basis.
again merit and seniority
could number be disregarded because the respondent was number
in the same class as the principal of the school of
mines. the pay of the principal was rs. 500-800 where
as the respondent was getting a salary of rs. 165 in
the grade of rs. 125-165 plus an allowance of rs. 75.
the companyrt also brought out the distinction between the
scope of art. 309 and art. 162 of the companystitution. it
observed
there were 1957 rules which spoke of appointment
by companypetitive examination or by selection or by
promotion. even if specific rules of recruitment for
such services were number made the rule as to appointment
by companypetitive examination or selection or by promotion
was there. article 162 does number companyfer power of
regularisation. article 162 does number companyfer power on
the government to make rules for the recruitment or
conditions of service. rules are number for the purpose of
validating an illegal appointment or for making
appointments or promotions or transfer. rules under
article 309 are for the purpose of laying down the
conditions of service and recruitment. therefore
regularisation by the way of rules under article 309 in
the present case by stating that numberwithstanding
anything in the rules the appointment of the respondent
was being regularised was in itself violation of the
rules as to appointment and as to cadre and also as to
the proper selection. in view of this clear authority it cannumber be argued for the
appellants that they companyld be appointed with retrospective
effect so as to affect the seniority of the respondents. the
orders dated 18th august and 26th september 1964 which
purported to appoint the sub-overseers named therein as
temporary overseers from the date of publication of their
result of diploma examination are clearly violative of arts. 14 and 16 of the companystitution inasmuch as the petitioners
had already been appointed as overseers by selection
committee companystituted under the rules companytained in p.w.d. companye. the order of temporary appointment by the impugned
orders dated 18th august and 26th september 1964 companyferred
national seniority on the companytesting respondents for the

was that the appellant dishonestly or fradulently induced
the income-tax authorities and obtainer an assessment order
for less income-tax than due. it was held that .the order
of assessment received by an assessee was property
since it was of great importance to the assessee as company-
taining a companyputation of his total assessable income and
as companytaintion or his tax liability. this companyrt
also expressed the view that the word property did number
necessarily expressed that the thing of which delivery
was dishonestly desired by the person who cheats must
have a money value or a market value in the hand of the
person cheated. it was held that even if the thing has no
money value in the hand of the person cheated but becomes
a thing of value in the hand of the person who may get
possession of it as a result of the cheating practised by
him it would still fall within the companynumberation of the
term property in section 420 i.p.c. this decision also

stated a passport is a valuable document. our attention has also been invited to in re packiana-

going to ceylon and he used the permit which stood in the
name of one kumarswami while his own name was j. packiana-
than. on seeing the permit the health officer issued a
health certificate. it was held that the health certificate
was property within the meaning of section 415 of the
penal companye and that if a person dishonestly and fraudulently
induced the health officer to deliver it to him he was
guilty of an offence under section 419 i.p.c. local govern-

at the police station charging the respondent for having
committed the offences under sections 302 and 201 of the

according to the persecution case the respondent was in love
with one of his girl students named nupur ghosh and this
led to the serious differences between the respondent and
his wife the unfortunate tara devi inducing the former to
clear the path of his misadventure in the manner alleged by

suggest that the alleged love-affair of the respondent led
tara devi to companymit suicide. whether the respondent will be
able to prove his defence at the final stage of the trial
may number be of much companysequence. surely the prosecution will

said plea. the first appellant in these appeals shri a. c. aggarwal. sub-divisional magistrate delhi issued numberices to the

or 7 as well as under s. 18 and  2  those companying only under
s. 18. they are two distinct classes of cases-a
classification which has reasonable relationship with the

from the companyies of the reports made in these cases to the
magistrate by the police-made available to us at the hearing
of these appeals-it is clear that they disclose offences
under s.3 against the respondents. therefore the question
is whether the magistrate can choose to ignumbere the
cognizable offence companyplained of and merely have recourse to
s.18 and thus deprive the parties proceeded against of the
benefit of a regular trial as well as the right of appeal in
the event of their companyviction. bearing in mind the purpose
of these provisions as well as the scheme of the act and on
a harmonious companystruction of the various provisions in the
act we are of the opinion that in cases like those before
us the magistrate who is also a companyrt as provided in s.22
must at the first instance proceed against the persons
complained against under the penal provisions in ss.3 or 7
as the case may be and only after the disposal of those
cases take action under s.18 if there is occasion for it. under s.190 1  b  of the companye of criminal procedure the
magistrate is bound to take companynizance of any companynizable
offence brought to his numberice. the words may. take companyni-
zance in the companytext means must take companynizance. he has
numberdiscretion in the matter otherwise that section will be
violative of art. 14. but as laid down in delhi
administration v. ram singh 1  only an officer mentioned in
s.13 can validly investigate an offence under the act. hence if the cases before us had been investigated by such
an officer there is numberdifficulty for the magistrate to
take companynizance of those cases. otherwise it is open to him

since the parties were at

tribunal found that the claim for payment of customary bonus
was substantiated it companyld have passed an order in favour of
the workmen for payment of such bonus. that claim had been
negatived. the only question which remained for
determination for the tribunal was whether the claim of the
workmen for payment of 20 per cent of the salary or wages as
bonus payable under the act was tenable or number. that
depended essentially on the question of existence of
available surplus and its quantum if any surplus was
available. in view of the finding recorded by the tribunal

in the same case lord thankerton expressed
the principle in similar language. lord
thankerton said at p. 371 of the report
 the principle to be applied
in such cases is that if the accident is shown
to have happened while the deceased was in the
course of his employment and at a place where
he was discharging the duties of his
employment and the accident is capable of
being attributed to a risk which is ordinarily
inherent in the discharge of such duties the
arbitrator is entitled to infer in the
absence of any evidence tending to an opposite
conclusion that the accident arose out of the
employment. in a later case in the house of lords rosen v.s.s. querous  owners  lord buckmaster explained that in
that passage in lord thankertons speech in simpsons
case 2  the place referred to was number the exact spot at
which the accident may have occurred but meant in that
case the train on which the workman was traveling and in the
later case in the house of lords the ship on which the
workman was employed. the same principle applies in indian
law as the language of s. 3 of the indian act is identical
with s. 1 of the english workmens companypensation act of 1925.
what are the facts found in the present case ? shaikh
hassan ibrahim was employed as a deck-hand a seaman of

court against the order but the high companyrt has summarily
dismissed the writ petition. in this appeal the appellant companytends that he fulfiled
the companyditions of eligibility and that there was no
justification for terminating his services. the case of the respondents is that the appellant was
appointed under a mistake inasmuch as the companydition of
eligibility required actual representation of a university
in an inter-university tournament companyducted by the inter-
university sports board and that therefore the appellant
was number entitled to any relief against the termination of
his services. having given the matter our careful companysideration it
seems to us that the respondents have proceeded on a
technical view of the matter wholly unjustified by the
intent behind the companydition of eligibility. the companydition
required that the applicant should have been a sportsman who
had represented his university in an inter-university
tournament companyducted by the inter-university sports board. there is numberdispute before us that the appellant did
qualify and was selected for representing the mithila
university in the inter-university tournament at the banaras
hindu university in the year 1972. all that remained was
that he should have participated in the tournament. unfortunately for him he fell ill and was unable to do so. the fact that he fell ill

is number disputed. there is numberhing to show that but for that
illness he would number have actually taken part in the
tournament. it seems to us that on a reasonable view of the
facts the appellant should be taken to have fulfilled the
condition of eligibility. the terms and companyditions of
service are intended to be companystrued reasonably and too
technical a view can defeat the essential spirit and intent
embodied in them. the intention was to appoint meritorious
sportsmen to the posts and that object is served if a

we are unable
to agree. in our opinion in order to ascertain the scope of
sub-s. 2  of s. 15 is necessary to read the act as a whole. we have pointed out earlier that the expression companylector
has been specifically defined by the act itself and the
definition requires that the officer must
be one specifically appointed by the central government to
perform the duties of a companylector detailed under the act and
rules. there are other provisions which have been
particularly enacted in the act.
but where such number-
compliance is due to the circumstances that numbercollector was
appointed to whom such returns companyld be furnished sub-s. 2 
of s.9 cannumber companye into play. however the obligation to
file a return remains and it remains in respect of the
entire period during which the companylector had number been
appointed and once the companylector is appointed the occupier
is obliged to file a return for the entire period from the
commencement of the levy including the period during which
there was numbercollector. that is because the liability to
excise duty had already accrued with the earliest excisable
event and it subsisted during the entire period including
the period during which there was numbercollector. the position
is that when the companylector is appointed the occupier must
within a reasonable time thereafter file monthly returns of
the produce companysumed or brought under processing or extracts
in the mill during each preceding month such monthly
returns being in respect of all the months included in the
period uptodate. or
the occupier may make a companyposite return specifying the
amount of such produce monthwise for the entire period. the
collector will then take the return into companysideration and
take proceedings under s.9 of the act. we hold that the delay in appointing the companylector
under the act does number relieve the appellant of the
liability to excise duty in respect of the period during
which the companylector was number appointed. this disposes of the further argument of the appellant
that as the appellate authority was appointed on august 21
1972 only there was numberliability to pay the duty in respect
of the period until such appointment. if the delay in
appointing the companylector does number furnish good ground for
excusing the occupier from such liability the delayed
appointment of the appellate authority also companystitutes no
defence. the only relief therefore to which the appellant can be
entitled in the present appeal would be an order restraining

conclusion that shyam behari lal  1st defendant  had been
validly adopted by gopal das is well founded. the suit from which this appeal arises is for possession of
the suit properties on the basis of title. the 1st
plaintiff debi prasad claims title to the properties as the
nearest heir to gopal das his maternal uncle who died in
1934. the 2nd plaintiff is an alienee from the 1st
plaintiff.
a large number of documents have been produced to show that
friends relations and even strangers were treating shyam
behari lal as the son of gopal das. the documents produced
before the companyrt companyclusively prove that right from 1907
till 1946 shyam behari lal wag treated as the son of gopal
das. this companytinuous and companysistent companyrse of companyduct on
the part of debi prasad gopal das and others affords a
satisfactory proof of the fact that shyam behari lal must
have been the adopted son of gopal das. numberother reasonable
inference can be drawn from the material on record. mr. desai appearing on behalf of the appellants companytended
that we should number accept the adoption pleaded firstly
because it was unlikely that gopal das would have taken a
child in adoption as far back as 1892 when he was only 32
years of age secondly the story that an one day old child
was taken in adoption when the family must have been in
pollution must be rejected as being repugnant to hindu
numberions and lastly in a decree of 1910 shyam behari lal was
described as the son of ram das his natural father. we are
unable to accept these companytentions. it is in evidence that
gopal das had lost three children even before 1890.
evidently he had lost all hopes of getting a natural son. further it is number necessary to speculate in the face of the
documentary evidence referred to earlier why gopal das
should have taken a son in adoption when there was every
possibility for him to get a natural son. companying to the
question of adoption on the very day shyam behari lal was
born that plea rests on hearsay information. there is no
positive evidence before us as to when exactly shyam behari
lal was adopted. from the evidence of d.ws. 10 and 15 it
is clear that he must have been adopted very soon after his
birth. that is the best that can be said on the basis of
the evidence. that a art custom differs from place to place
and from companymunity to companymunity. it is true that in a
decree made in 1910 shyam behari lal was described as the
son of ram das. but in the very next year in anumberher
decree he was
described as the son of gopal das. we do number think that the
evidence afforded by that solitary document showing shyam
behari lal as the son of ram das can outweigh the other evi-
dence which is both satisfactory as well as voluminumbers.",0,1,DEBI PRASAD DEAD BY LRS,TRIBENI DEVI AND ORS

1962_65,"the principal point which the appellant
the state of west bengal has raised for our decision in the
present appeal is whether the provisions of section 540 of
the companye of criminal procedure apply to a case tried by the
magistrate under section 207a of the companye. that question
arises in this way.
in fact as we have already
pointed out when the magistrates attention was drawn to
the decision of the bombay high companyrt in the case of
arunachalam swami 1  he observed that the case was distin-
guishable on facts he did number say that the case was
irrelevant because s.540 was inapplicable to the proceedings
before him. if he had taken the view that s.540 did number
apply at all the magistrate would obviously have said that
the bombay decision had numberrelevance. the reason given by
the magistrate that the case was distinguishable on facts
postulates that s.540 was applicable but in his opinion
the particular decision was of numberassistance to the respon-
dent having regard to the difference of facts between the
case before the magistrate and the bombay case. therefore
the order passed by the magistrate cannumber be successfully
challenged on the ground that the

a. i. r. 1956 bom. 695.
magistrate did number companysider the question under s. 540 of the
code. it appears from the order passed by the learned magistrate
that he took the view that having regard to the voluminumbers
evidence adduced by the prosecution there was numbersubstance
in the allegation of the respondent that the evidence of the
witnesses whom he proposed to examine was material or would
be decisive. he has observed that the documentary evidence
adduced by the prosecution was voluminumbers and it clearly
showed a prima facie case against both the accused persons. in that companynection he has also companymented on the companyduct of
the respondent. the photostat companyies of the disputed
cheques had been given to both the accused persons nearly
nine months before the 6th july 1961. arguments in respect
of these documents were urged before the magistrate nearly
two months before the said date. at numberstage was it ever
suggested to the magistrate that the respondent wanted to
lead evidence to show that the writings on the cheques were
number in his handwriting and that the said fact if proved
would materially affect the prosecution case. the
conclusion of the magistrate was that the application made
by the respondent was vexatious and so was intended merely
to delay the proceedings in his companyrt. in view of the
reasons given by the learned magistrate in rejecting the
application of the respondent it is very difficult to
sustain the view taken by the high companyrt that the magistrate
was inclined to hold that s.540 did number apply to the
proceedings in the present case. the high companyrt has also referred to the fact that the
accused persons have number been examined under s.342 of the
code and it has apparently asked the magistrate to examine
the accused persons under that section without companysidering
the question as to whether it was necessary that the
magistrate should

the appellant is a manufacturer of cement in the

the marketing companypany had its establishment at nagpur

therefore a

who was said to have been located outside the state of

company can be taken to be companyered by the explanation. the
explanation which was repealed by the sixth amendment of the

question for companysideration thus is does the presence of the
explanation make any difference? what has been found as a fact in the statement of the
case is that there was preceding local sales companyplete in
every respect within madhya pradesh by which title to the
cement had passed from the appellant to the marketing

rule of primogeniture. we are number companycerned with that
aspect of the matter but only with lie question whether the
alienation in favour of the plaintiffs father was valid
and we think on the companystruction of the various wat hukums
that it was number. we agree with the full bench that the
bombay hereditary offices act  watan act  did number apply to
the kolhapur state so as to override the specific directions

a specific prohibition from alienating patel-ki-watan and
other similar inams we need number rely on the provisions of

1951_10,"We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench. On a plain reading of the language of sections 12 and 50 it seems clear to us that the Act was given retrospective operation only to a limited extent and execution proceedings and appeals were excluded from this effect and were to be governed by the provisions of the law in force at the time when the decrees were passed. The concluding words of section 50 and there- upon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings fully bear out this construction. Mr. Daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the Act, and that section 12 of the Act which gives protection to tenants should \
 A. I. R. 1949 Bom. 210. be construed as having retrospective effect. In our opinion this contention is not sound. Section 50 cannot be de- scribed as a section providing merely for transfer of pend- ing cases to courts having jurisdiction to deal with them. It is on the other hand a repeal section in the new stat- ute. \
 It repeals the two earlier statutes, and while repeal- ing them it provides that the repeal shall not affect executions and appeals and that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all pending suits which shall be transferred to the courts having jurisdiction to hear them under section 28 of the Act. We are also inclined to agree with the view of the Full Bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective. Sub-section (2) clearly relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force. \
 It cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the Act was put on the statute book. Sub-section (3) which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into operation because it in terms states in such suit and not in any suit. Such suit can only be a suit referred to in subsec- tions (2) and (3) of section 12.",1,0,CHANDRASINGH MANIBHAI AND OTHERS,SURJIT LAL LADHAMAL CHHABDAAND OTHERS
1951_30,"In his opinion, the entire judgment displays a lack of true perspective in a case of this kind. The Sessions Judge had completely misdirected himself in looking to the minor discrepancies in the case and ignoring the essential matters so far as the case is concerned, and there was no justifiable ground for rejecting the prosecution evidence regarding the cultivation and harvesting by Polai. And he concluded with the warning I would, however, make it per- fectly clear that when the case is re-tried, which I am now going to order, the Judge proceeding with the trial will not be in the least influenced by any expression of opinion which I may have given in this judgment. 
On behalf of the appellants Mr. Sinha raised two conten- tions. In the first place, he submitted that having regard to section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides for an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal only at the instance of the Government, a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent, and, secondly, that sub-section (4) of section 439 clearly showed that the High Court exceeded its powers of revision in the present case in upsetting the findings of fact of the trial Judge. 
We think it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the first contention of Mr. Sinha especially as the respondent is unrepresented, as we are of opinion that his second and alternative contention must prevail. It will be seen from the judgment summarised above that the learned Judge in the High Court re-appraised the evi- dence in the case and disagreed with the Sessions Judges findings of fact on the ground that they were perverse and displayed a lack of true perspective. 
He went further and, by way of expressing in very clear terms as to how perverse the judgment of the court below is, he indicated that the discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the circum- stances of the case which led the Sessions Judge to discred- it the prosecution story afforded no justifiable ground for the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish their case.
We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court did not properly appreciate the scope of inquiry in revision against an order of acquittal. Though sub-section(1) of section 439 authorises the High Court to exercise, in its discretion, any of the powers conferred on a court of appeal by section 423, sub-section (4) specifically excludes the power to convert a finding of acquittal into one. of conviction. 
This does not mean that in dealing with a revision petition by a private party against an order of acquittal, the High Court could in the absence of any error on a point of law re-appraise the evidence and reverse the findings of facts on which the acquittal was based, provided only it stopped short of finding the accused guilty and passing sentence on him. 
By merely characterising the judgment of the trial Court as perverse and lacking in perspective, the High Court cannot reverse pure findings of fact based on the trial Courts appreciation of the evidence in the case.",1,0,LOGENDRANATH JHA  OTHERS,SHRI POLAILAL BISWAS
1951_33,"This application however was rejected, because it was made at a very late stage, that is to say, after the defendants evidence had been closed and an adjournment had been granted to the plaintiff to adduce rebutting evidence. However that may be, the utmost that can be said upon the evidence as it stands is that by the implied consent of the parties the period of the lease was extended up to the 31st March, 1938. In this view, the respondent No. 1 became entitled to re-enter after the 31st March, and no notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was necessary. In the circumstances, the decree for ejectment passed by the courts below must be upheld. The next question which arises in the case turns on the proper construction of clause 11 of Part I and clause 1 of Part III of the lease, which have already been quoted. It seems to us that clause 11 should be read as a whole, and, when it is so read, it becomes clear that it was intended to be applicable only where the Secretary of State decided to exercise his right to terminate the lease at any time subject to 6 months notice, in the event of the lessee failing to observe and duly perform the conditions mentioned in the lease. In such a case, if the lessee did not remove the boilers, engines and all other materials and yield up the premises to the Secretary of State, those articles were to become the property of the Secretary of State. This clause is evidently not applicable to the present case. The clause which applies to this case is clause 1 of Part III, which is intended to be applicable to the normal case of the lease expiring by efflux of time. This clause, as we have seen, provides that the lessee shall be at liberty to keep on the demised premises for 3 months after the expiration of the lease any bricks, boilers, etc., but it also provides that any bricks and other materials left in contravention of this condition shall become the absolute property of the Secretary of State without payment. There can be no doubt that under this clause, the bricks and other materials have become the absolute property of the plaintiff. 
 The only question is as to the meaning of other materials. It seems to us on an examination of the lease as a whole that there must be a distinction between materials, and machinery and tools and similar articles, and the words other materials have no reference to engines, trucks, railway and tramway lines and plant. They mean building materials such as bricks, tiles and similar articles that might have been manufactured by the appellants on the demised premises. That being so, the decree under appeal should be modified accordingly. The only other point which arises for consideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants, to restrain them from removing or otherwise disposing of the articles in regard to which the decree is to be passed. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent No. 1 not being in possession of these properties could not ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them, and in support of this proposition, the following cases were cited - Ratnasabhapathi Pillai and Others v. Ramaswami Aiyar I.L.R. 33 Mad. 482, Bhramar Lal Banduri and Others v. Nanda Lal Chowdhuri 24 I.C. 199 and Valia Tamburatti v. Parvati and Others I.L.R. 13 Mad. 455. After reading and fully considering those cases, we find them to be wholly inapplicable to the present case. In the present case, it has been found that the bricks and other materials have become the property of the plaintiff, and there can be no legal objection to the granting of an injunction as prayed.",0,1,Karnani Industrial Bank Limited,The Province Of Bengal And Ors.
1951_35,"The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1). In substance, it was nothing but a certification by the decree-holder of the satisfaction of the decree. The mere fact (1) 33 C.W.N. 267 A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 19, that the document was in the form of a petition could not convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement. It was purely an intimation given to the Court by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of Court and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely consequential and would follow as a matter of course on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded. The order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled. In my judgment, that petition (Ex. 2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of section 2 (22) of the Act. For reasons stated above, the decrees sought to be reopened were not decrees made in a suit to which this Act applies. Suit No. 78 of 1922 was neither instituted on or after January 1, 1939, nor was it pending on that date, all the three decrees having been passed long before that date. Nor was any proceeding in execution such as is contemplated by section 2 (22) instituted or pending on or after that date. The Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 was at an end on January 30, 1937, and the petition of June 2, 1939, was not an application at all and was certainly not a proceeding in execution within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act. This conclusion is sufficient to dismiss this appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider the other question raised by the respondent on the strength of section 36 (5) of the Act and I express no opinion on that question. The result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and I order accordingly. KANIA C.J.--I agree. PATANJALI SASTRI J.--The facts bearing on the dispute in this appeal are fully stated in the judgment of ray brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them here. The appellant mortgagor seeks in these proceedings the reliefs provided by the Bengal Money-lenders Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in respect of a decree debt payable by him. The respondent who represents the sub-mortgagee decree-holder invokes the protection of two exemptions contained in the Act (1) Section 86 (1), proviso (ii), which exempts inter alia any decree other than a decree in a suit to which this Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939.
The Act affords relief to certain classes of debtors by curtailing pro tanto the rights of the creditors, subject to certain exceptions in regard to assignments of loans. In such a context the only relevant consideration could be whether the assignment is such as to establish a debtor and creditor relation between the assignee and the debtor so as to bring the case within the purview of the Act. If the sub-mortgagee obtained, by virtue of the sub- mortgage, the right to sue the original mortgagor for recov- ery of the mortgage debt, that would seem sufficient to make him an assignee within the meaning of the Act. It was from this point of view that the question as to the nature of the right transferred to a sub-mortgagee under his sub-mortgage was considered in Promode Kumar Roy v. Nikhil Bhusan Mukho- padhya(1) as it has to be considered in the present case, and the reference to the sub-mortgage containing an assign- ment of all the rights (1) 76 I,A.",0,0,KUMAR PASHUPATINATH MALIA  ANOTHER,DEBA PROSANNA MUKHERJEE
1951_36,"The im- pugned section is a general one and applies to all kinds of shops that is to say, to those in which labour is employed as well as to those which are run by the owners and their families. The Act in which the section occurs is directed at regulating the hours of employment of persons who are employed in the business of shops or commercial establish- ments. Therefore, in so far as section 7 covers establish- ments where labour is employed, it is undoubtedly intra vires. But it was argued that the section can have no appli- cation to shops which an owner runs with or without the assistance of his family. Reliance for this was placed on section 2-A (i) and (j) which is as follows 2-A. Nothing in this Act shall apply to-- 
 persons employed in a managerial capacity and (j) the members of the family of the employer. It was argued that the sale was by the son. He is not affected by the Act. Therefore. he was entitled to sell and he could not sell unless the shop was kept open to enable him to do so. So also as regards the appel- lant, the owner, who was there in a managerial capacity. In our opinion, this is fallacious because the conviction here is not for the sale but for keeping the shop open on a close day. Section 2-A (j) does not give the son a right to keep the shop open or, for that matter, a right to sell. All it says is that he, being a member of the family, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Act. Section 7(1), on the other hand, is directed against the owner of the shop, not against his family. It compels the owner to keep his shop closed one day in a week. 
 It was then contended that if a person employed in a managerial capacity cannot be affected by the Act, then the appellant who was there in that capacity cannot be compelled to close the shop under section 7. This is also fallacious. It happens in the present case that the owner and the manag- er are the same but the Act obviously makes provision for a class of case in which they are different. The owner is obliged to close the shop one day in a week, though the manager of the shop can work without, for example, having the twenty-four consecutive hours of rest every week which section 7-A enjoins. The appellants capacity as manager will have to be separated from his character as owner for this purpose. Section 2-A(i) does not control section 7 (1). Lastly, it was argued that the scheme of the Act makes it plain that it is for ameliorating the conditions of labour employed in shops. It cannot therefore apply to shops in which no labour is employed, particularly when the family of the employer is expressly excluded from the purview of the Act. For this reason also, it cannot fall under item 27 in List III. We are of opinion that such a narrow interpre- tation cannot be placed upon the entry. The legislature may have felt it necessary, in order to reduce the possibilities of evasion to a minimum, to encroach upon the liberties of those who would not otherwise have been affected. That we think it had power to do.",0,1,MANOHAR LAL,THE STATE
1951_40,"In those circumstances the remainder was sublet for fourteen years at an annual rent of pound 1,150. The general commissioners of income-tax decided that the difference of pound 400 between the outgoing of pound 750 for the land retained and the incoming of pound 1,150 for the land disposed of was income received from an invest- ment, and, the business not being one within the special categories mentioned in the Finance Act, 1939, that pound 400 was not taxable. 
 It was held that the word investment must be construed in the ordinary, popular sense of the word as used by businessmen and not as a (1) 1946 1 A.E.R.58. (3) 1946 2 A.E.R. 609. (2) 1947 1 A.E.R. 798. term of art having a defined or technical meaning and that it was impossible to say that the commissioners had erred in law in coming to the conclusion that the transaction result- ed in an investment. Scott L.J. in delivering his judgment laid emphasis on the point that after the business of the company had dwindled, it partitioned part of the land from the rest and sublet it by installing a heating apparatus for the sub-lessee. 
 It was found that war conditions had reduced the companys business to very small proportions and they cut their loss by going out of business in respect of the major part of their land and put it out of their power for 14 years to resume business there. In this situation it was observed that in that case they were dealing with part of the property of the company which had come redundant and was sublet purely to produce income--a transaction. quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company. 
 It was pointed out that the question whether a particular source of income was income or not must be decided, as it could be, according to ordinary commonsense principles. The short question to decide in this case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu- facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non-availability of yarn. It is difficult to conceive that the company would not have immediately started dyeing yarn as soon as it became available. Instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute (we are told), the assessee company making income out of its use as a commercial asset.",1,1,COMMISSIONER OF EXCESS PROFITS TAXBOMBAY CITY,SRI LAKSHMI SILK MILLS LTD
1951_64,"He seems to have had the whip hand. Instead of doing that he entered into an arrangement which, while giving him the necessary facili- ties, appears to have satisfied the company by allowing it to retain its investments without a precipitate liquidation of a large portion thereof. It does not matter whether the company was right in this view or wrong, and in any event we are in no position to judge of the soundness of its decision because we have not all the materials before us. It has to be remembered that considerations of this kind go deeper than the apparent profit or loss on an isolated transaction standing by itself. 
 It is not enough to say that the 50,000 shares which were cancelled earned in the following year only 31/2 per cent. interest as against 5 per cent. on the debentures because we do not know to what extent the hold- ings of the company would have been disturbed if this had not been done. What we do know is what the Income-tax Appel- late Tribunal has stated, namely, that-- the change brought about had been so designed that the investments of the company were not to be disturbed and as a consequence the income accrued was in no way to be affected. This has only to be stated to show the commercial nature of the transaction from the companys point of view. 
 The High Court considered that the capital of the compa- ny could have been reduced in other ways. But that again is not the point. There are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought about in business circles but it is not for the Court to decide which of them should have been employed when the Court is deciding a question under section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act. 
It was argued on behalf of the respondent (basing the same on paragraph 7 of the appellants application to the High Court dated 5th April, 1947) that the company had at the time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process. But that again is not the point. The company chose to do it this way, and as there was not even a sugges- tion of fraud, the only question is whether it was gone through as an ordinary commercial proposition. But we doubt if that is what paragraph 7 meant because in paragraph 4 of the application to the High Court dated 11th February, 1944, the petitioner stated that the money on hand and at short notice was only Rs. 8,94,379. That is a good deal short of 50 lacs. However, we need not enter into this in detail. On a full review of the facts it is clear that this transaction was voluntarily entered into in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business of the company and was made on the ground of commercial expediency. 
 It therefore falls within the purview of section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 before its amendment in 1939. This being an investment company, if it borrowed money and utilised the same for its investments on which it earned income, the interest paid by it on the loans will clearly be a permissible deduction under section 12(2) of the Income- tax Act. Whether the loan is taken on an overdraft, or is a fixed deposit or on a debenture makes no difference in law. The only argument urged against allowing this deduction to be made is that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold the ordinary shares. 
 It cannot be disputed that if the debentures were held by a third party, the interest payable on the same would be an allowable deduction in calculating the total income of the assessee company. What difference does it make if the holder of the debentures is a shareholder ?",1,1,EASTERN INVESTMENTS LTD,COMMISSIONER OF INCOMETAXWEST BENGAL
1951_80,"This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution praying for the release of the peti- tioner from his alleged unlawful detention. 
We accepted the petition and, at the conclusion of the hearing, ordered the petitioner to be released., We now proceed to give the reasons for our order. The petitioner was arrested and detained under an order dated 1st March, 1950, made by the District Magistrate, Amritsar, under section3(1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Act ) and the grounds of detention were communicated to the petitioner as required by section7 of the Act on 15th March, 1950. 
The petitioner challenged the validity of the order on various grounds but, while the petition was pending after this Court issued a rule nisi to the respondent, the petitioner was served on 6th August with another detention order dated 30th July,1951 1, purporting to be made by the Governor of Punjab under sub-section(1) of section 3 and section 4 of the Act as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, and he was served with fresh grounds of detention on 16th August, 1951.
It will be seen that the terms of the order make it clear that it was intended to operate as a fresh order for the detention of the petitioner and this view is strengthened by the fact that the order was followed by the service of a fresh set of grounds on the petitioner as required by sec- tion 7 of the Act a proceeding which would be wholly unnec- essary if no fresh order of detention was intended. Indeed, it was suggested on behalf of the petitioner that the said order followed by service of fresh grounds only four days before the date fixed for the hearing of the petition by this Court was a deliberate move by the respondent to cir- cumvent the objections raised by the petitioner to the validity of the earlier order of 1st March, 1950, and thus render the proceeding infructuous. 
However that may be, we are clearly of opinion that the order dated 30th July, 1951. must be regarded as a fresh order made for the petitioners detention in superession of the earlier order and the ques- tion is whether it was illegal in that it straightaway directed that the petitioner be detained till 31st March, 1952, which was the date of the expiry of the Act. Whatever might be the position under the Act before its amendment in February, 1951, it is clear that the Act as amended requires that every.case of detention should be placed before an Advisory Board constituted under the Act (section 9) and provides that if the Board reports that there is sufficient cause for the detention the appropriate Government may confirm the detention order and continue the detention of the person concerned for such period as it thinks fit (section 11). 
It is, therefore, plain that it is only after the Advisory Board, to which the case has been referred, reports that the detention is justified, the Government should determine what the period of deten- tion should be and not before. The fixing of the period of detention in the initial order itself in the present case was, therefore, contrary to the scheme of the Act and cannot be supported. The learned Advocate-General, however, urged that in view of the provision in section 11 (2) that if the Advisory Board reports that there is no sufficient cause for the detention, the person concerned would be released forth- with, the direction in the order dated 30th July, 1951, that the petitioner should be detained till 31st March, 1952, could be ignored as mere surplusage.",1,0,MAKHAN SINGH TARSIKKA,THE STATE OF PUNJAB

The petitioner and his ancestors have been owing and enjoying these properties in full proprietary right for several generations past.
The guarantee has no greater scope than this. That guarantee has been fully respected by the impugned statue as it treats treats those properties is their private properties and seeks to acquire them on that assumption. Moreover it seems to me that in view of the comprehensive language of article 363 this issue is not justiciable. This petition is accordingly dismissed but there will be no order of costs.

Seven of these are by zamindars from Madhya Pradesh who are owners of estates. The petitioner in Petition No. 246 also owns certain malguzari villages. Petitioner in Petition No. 237 is a malguzar of eighteen villages but owns no estate. Petitions Nos. 280 to 285 and 257 relate to merged territories. The petitioner in Petition No. 282 was ruler of a State (Jashpur) and the petition concerns his private properties. Petitioners in Petitions Nos. 283, 284 and 285 are Ilakadars and in Petitions Nos. 280 and 285 they are mafidars. Petitioner in Petition No. 281 is a Thikedar i.e., revenue farmer of three villages. Mr. Swami reiterated the contention raised by Mr. Somayya that the Act was not duly passed by the legislature. For the reasons given in Petition No. 166 of 1951, I see no force in this contention, Mr. Swami also reiterated Mr. Bindras contention that the legislation was not bona fide. For the reasons given in Petition No. 317, this contention is not accepted. Mr. Swami Vehemently argued that the Government has by this Act become a super- zamindar, that there is no public purpose behind the Act, that there is no change in the existing order of things, that the Act has achieved nothing new, the tenants remain as they were, the malikan cabza were also already in existence, that acquisition of that status by occupancy tenants was possible under existing statutes and that they had also the power of transfer of their holdings. In my opinion, the argument is based on a fallacy. As already stated, the purpose of the Act is to bring about reforms in the land tenure system of the State by establishing direct contact between the tillers of the soil and the Government. These petitions are accordingly dismissed. I make no order of costs in them. Mr. Mukherji who appeared in this petition merely adopted the arguments taken in other petitioners. For the reasons given therein this petition is also dismissed, but I make no order as to costs in it. Petition No. 487 of 1951.

All that the covenant does is to recognise the title of the Ruler as owner of certain properties.

The fact that his personal properties are sought to be acquired on payment of compensation clearly recognises his title just as the titles of other proprietors are recognised.",0,0,Visweshwar Rao,The State Of Madhya Pradesh
1952_60,"It was not a case of an individual workers failure to turn up for work. It was a concerted action on the part of a large number of workers. The Appellate Tribunal was thus in error in not regarding it as a strike and it had no discretion not to regard what in law was a strike as not amounting to a strike. If it cannot be denied that the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948, amounted to a strike, then it was certainly an illegal strike because no notice had been given to the management, the Mills being a public utility industry. It was contended by the President of the Union, who argued the case on behalf of the workers, that the Factories Act had no application to this case, because by a notification of the Government of Madras dated 23rd August, 1946, the Buckingham an Carnatic Mills had been exempted from the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Act and the provisions of sections 49-A and 49-B were not therefore attracted to it and that no substantial question of law in respect to the construction of the section fell to be decided by this Court and that being so, this Court should not entertain this appeal under article 136 of the Constitution. This contention has no validity. The Mills were granted exemption from the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Factories Act because their leave rules were in accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Factories Act. These rules being in similar terms, the decision of the matter depends on the construction of the rules and this in- volves a substantial question of law. 
Reliance was next placed on section 49-A of the Factories Act which provides that the provisions of the new Act would not operate to the prejudice of any rights which the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was argued that under the leave rules of the Mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the Factories Act, the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49-B or in the new rules and that the Mills had no right to deprive them of leave by reason of the strike. 
This contention cannot be sustained because section 49-A (2) of the Factories Act has no application to the case of the Carnatic Mills in view of the notification dated 23rd August, 1946. Lastly, it was urged that the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948, was not a concerted action -on the part of the workers and that several workers in their own individual capacity wanted leave on that date. In our opinion, in view of the facts and circumstances detailed in the adjudicators award this contention cannot be seriously considered. We concur in the view of the facts taken by the adjudicator that the action of the 859 workers on the night of 1st November, 1948, fell within the definition of the word strike as given in section 2(q) of the Industrial Disputes Act and it was an illegal strike and the workers thus lost the benefit of holidays that they would have otherwise got under the rules. The learned counsel for the appellant undertook on behalf of the management ex gratia that it would condone the default of the workers on 1st November, 1948, and the cessation of work on that night would not be treated as depriving them of the holidays under the rules and we appreciate -the spirit in which this undertaking was given and hope that the workers would also take it in that spirit.",1,0,BUCKINGHAM AND CARNATIC CO  LTD,WORKERS OF THE BUCKINGHAM ANDCARNATIC CO  LTD
1952_75,"Mr. Gumaste, who appears for the appellant, says that his claim is not a claim against the Government but in that case be ought to strike out the Government. He is not prepared to strike out the Government because if he does they will not be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals. Therefore, he wants to make the Government a party in order that they may be bound. But, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the Government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind Government. They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was ousted. It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay v. Hormusji Manekji (74 I.A. 103) that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first. In my opinion, this decision does not apply here. Their Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876. That provides that \
 no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to (b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Government. As pointed out by Strangman K. C. on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, authorised must mean duly authorised and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11-4-1930 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code. Thus, before the exclusion of the Civil Courts jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires. Consequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar. But the position here is different. We are concerned here with section 4 (a) under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises. The section is general and bars all claims against the Crown relating to lands held as Saranjam. That is to say, even if the Government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land. \
 There is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration. One set of decision holds that that does not amount to a claim against Government. Dattatraya Vishwanath v. The Secretary of State for India I.L.R. 1948 Bom. 809 at 820 is typical of that view.

1953_14,"In our view the above observation is apposite and applies to the case before us. The true implication of the above observation as of the decisions in the other cases referred to above is that the pre-existing right of appeal is not destroyed by the amendment if the amendment is not made retrospective by express words or necessary intendment. The fact that the pre-existing right of appeal continues to exist must, in its turn, necessarily imply that the old law which created that right of appeal must also exist to support the continuation of that right. As the old law continues to exist for the purpose of supporting the pre- existing right of appeal that old law must govern the exercise and enforcement of that right of appeal and there can then be no question of the amended provision preventing the exercise of that right. The argument that the authority has no option or jurisdiction to admit the appeal unless it be accompanied by the deposit of the assessed tax as required by the amended proviso to section 22(1) of the Act overlooks the fact of existence of the old law for the purpose of supporting the pre-existing right and really amounts to begging the question. The new proviso is wholly inapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of the authority has to be exercised under the old law which so continues to exist. The argument of Sri Ganapathy lyer on this point, therefore, cannot be accepted. The learned Advocate urges that the requirment as to the deposit of the amount of the assessed costs does not affect the right of appeal itself which still remains intact, but only introduces a new matter of procedure.
A provision which is calculated to deprive the appellant of the unfettered right of appeal cannot be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure. Indeed the new requirement cannot be said merely to regulate the exercise of the appellants pre-existing right but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannot be regarded as a mere rule of procedure. Finally, Sri Ganapathy lyer faintly urges that until actual assessment there can be no lis and, therefore, no right of appeal can accrue before that event. There are two answers to this plea. Whenever there is a proposition by one party and an opposition to that proposition by another a lis arises. 
 It may be conceded, though not deciding it, that when the assessee files his return a lis may not immediately arise, for under section 11 (1) the authority may accept the return as correct and complete. But if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and calls for evidence, surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by the State. The circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the judge can make no difference, for the authority raises the dispute in the interest of the State and in so acting only represents the State. 
 It 1000 will appear from the dates given above that in this case the lis in the sense explained above arose before the date of amendment of the section. Further, even if the lis is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment, there was a possibility of such a lis arising as soon as proceedings started with the filing of the return or, at any rate, when the authority called for evidence and started the hearing and the right of appeal must be taken to have been in existence even at those dates. For the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant date is the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself.",1,0,HOOSEIN KASAM DADA INDIA LTD,THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS
1953_26,"This is an appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay declaring the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, (Act XXIV of 1952), ultra vires the State Legislature and issuing a writ in the nature of mandamus against the State of Bombay and the Collector of Sales Tax, Bombay, appellants herein, directing them to forbear and desist from enforcing the provisions of the said Act against the respondents who are dealers in motor cars in Bombay. 
 The Legislature of the State of Bombay enacted the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, (hereinafter referred to as ,the Act) and it was brought into force on October 9, 1952, by notification issued under section 1 (3) of the Act, except sections 5, 9, 10 and 47 which came into operation on November 1, 1952, as notified under section 2 (3). On, the same day the rules made by the State Government in exercise of the power conferred by section 45 of the Act also came into force. 1075 On November 3, 1952, the respondents 1 to 6, who are companies incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and respondent No. 7, a partnership firm, all of whom are carrying on business in Bombay of buying and selling motor cars, presented a petition to the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act on the ground that it is ultra vires the State Legislature, inasmuch as it purported to tax sales arid purchases of goods regardless of the restrictions imposed on State legislative power by article 286 of the Constitution. It was also alleged that the provisions of the Act were discriminatory in their effect and, therefore, void under article 14 read with article 13 of the Constitution. The respondents accordingly prayed for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus against the appellants preventing them from enforcing the provisions of the Act against the respondents.
The State in which the property in the goods passes would not be able to tax such sale or purchase in the absence of a provision enacted by law by Parliament within the meaning of article 286(2). Once that ban is lifted by the appropriate legislation enacted by the Parliament the State in which the property in the goods passes would also be entitled to tax such sale or purchase but not otherwise. Save as above, I agree with the conclusions reached by my Lord the Chief Justice in the judgment just delivered. I agree that the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, and the rules made, thereunder except Rule 5(2)(1) do not contravene the provisions of article 286, that Rule 5(2)(1) is clearly severable and can be ignored, that there is no substance in the contention of Shri Seervai that there is a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 14 and that the taxation statutes should be construed in a manner so as to allow the statute itself to stand, the taxing authority being prevented by injunction from imposing the tax on subjects excluded by the Constitution from the purview of taxation by the State. 
 In the result the declaration Made by the court below will be set aside, the writ issued by it will be quashed and the State of Bombay will be prohibited from imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on sales or purchases which according to the interpretation put above on article 286 are excluded from the purview 1129 of taxation by the State of Bombay.",1,0,THE STATE OF BOMBAY AND ANOTHER,THE UNITED MOTORS INDIA LTD AND OTHERSUNION
1953_57,"This is an appeal by an assessee against a judgment and order of the High Court at Bombay delivered on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Bombay High Court refused leave to appeal but the assessee obtained special leave from this Court. The appellant deals in silver and shares and a substantial part of his holding is kept in silver bullion and shares. His business is run and owned by himself. His accounts are maintained according to the mercantile system. It is admitted that under this system stocks can be valued in one of two ways and provided there is no variation in the method from year to year without the sanction of the Income-tax authorities an assessee can choose whichever method, that is to say, the cost price of the stock was wnterred at the beginning of the year and not its market value and similarly the cost price was again entered at the close of the year of any stock which was not disposed of during the yeaar.
The question referred were - 
 Whether in the circumstances of the case any income arose to the assessee as a result of the transfer of hsres and silver bars to the trustees? If the answer to question (I) is in afirmative, whether the method employed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal in computing the assessees income from the transfer is the proper method for computing the income? Our answer to the first question is that in the circumstances of this case no income arose to the appellant as a result of the transfer of the shares and silver bars to the trustees. In view of that, the second question does not arise. The appeal is allowed with costs.
In my opinion the manner of his dealing with the asset after he withdraws it from the stock-in-trade of the business is really immmaterial. What is material from the stock-in-trade of the business and that vlaue can only be determine by the market value of the asset as at the date of its withdrawal.
With great respect to the learned Judges I do not see my way to agree with the reasoning of this judgment does not take count of the fact that at the date of the partition the assets which had been brought into the business at the earlier dates had depreciated in value and it was these depreciated assets which were the subject-matter of partition between the partners. Even if the partition be not treated as a sale it was a transer of property, the property of the firm being transferred to the individual partners thereof and each partner obtaining an absolute interest in the shares thus transferred to him by the firm was concerned it was certainly a transfer of the property to the individual partners and even as regards the partners themselves it was transfer of the interests of the partners inter se in the shares respectively transferred absolutely to each of them. If it were necessary to do so I would certainly say that the case was erroneously decided.",1,1,Commissioner Of Income-Tax,Kikabhai Premchand
1953_74,"This is appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay delivered on a reference under Section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, whereby the High Court answered the first referred question in the negative. The assessment in question concern the year 1943-44. A Hindu undivided family was carrying on business in Bombay, Madras and the Mysore State. Its business was taken over by a registered firm on March 17, 1942. For the purpose of this appeal however this circumstance is not material. The case has been dealt with on the assumption that a single assessee carried on business from October 10, 1948, to November 8, 1942, the relevant accounting year. According to the accounts of the assessee, during this period the Mysore branch purchased goods from the Bombay head office and the Madras branch of the value of Rs. 2,45,455. The Income-tax Officer estimated these purchases of the Mysore branch in British India at Rs. 3,00,000 and its profits at Rs. 75,000 on the sale of these goods in Mysore. In view of the provisions of Section 42 of the Act half of this profit, i.e., to the extent of Rs. 37,500, was deemed to accrue or a rise in British India, because of the business connection of the non-resident branch in British India. It was contended that the assessee being a person resident in India, Section 42 could not be invoked in the case, because that section had application only to cases of non-resident.
The same view was expressed by Mukherjea, J. Nothing that has been said by Mr. Kolah before us justifies reconsideration of these opinions. Mr. Kolah argued that when the world income of a resident was brought within the net of chargeability by Section 4 in 1939 it was then wholly unnecessary to include such an assessee in the ambit of Section 42. In our judgment, this contention is fallacious. Whatever income arises in a primary sense to a resident in the taxable territories is chargeable under Section 4(1)(b)(i). Hence it was necessary to make Section 42 applicable to such a case. Whatever other consideration may arise in estimating the foreign income of a resident will not be applicable to income deemed to accrue within the taxable territory. Moreover, as above pointed out, in view of the provisions of Section 14(2)(c), resident assessees, but for Section 42(1), would not be liable to assessment regarding income accruing to them in Part B States, even if there is a business connection in the taxable territory. 
 Mr. Kolan was unable to suggest any reasonable explanation for the deletion of the words any person residing out of British India from Section 42(1) as it stood before 1939. The only purpose in deleting these words could be to bring residents within the ambit of the section. There is no reason whatsoever for not giving to the palin words of the section the meaning that on the face of it they bear. For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the answer re turned by the High Court of Bombay to the first question referred to it was wrong.",1,0,Commissioner Of ...,Bhogilal Laherchand
1954_0,"This is an appeal by special leave against the order made on the 20th November, 1951, by the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh in proceedings instituted by the respondents under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to the present appeal. The appellants were tenants of a certain shop premises situate in Solan Bazar in the district of Mahasu in Himachal Pradesh. On the llth October, 1947, they had executed a rent deed by which they agreed to pay an annual rent of Rs. 175 payable as to Rs. 50 on the last of Baisakh and as to the balance of Rs. 125 in the month of October, in default of which payment, the respondents, as landlords, would be entitled to recover the whole of the said rent in one lump sum.
He accordingly set aside the orders of the courts below and allowed the application for ejectment but gave the appelants three months time for vacating the premises. The appellants have now come up before this court on appeal by special leave obtained from this court. Learned advocate appearing in support of this appeal urges that the learned Judicial Commissioner acted wholly without jurisdiction inasmuch as (1) the Rent Controller or the District Judge exercising powers under the Act was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, article 227 confers no power on the court of the Judicial Commissioner over the Rent Controller or the District Judge, and (2) that article 227 read with article 241 confers no power of judicial superintendence on the court of the Judicial Commissioner. Re. l.-The court of the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh exercises jurisdiction in relation to the whole of the territories of Himachal Pradesh. The Rent Controller and the District Judge exercising jurisdiction under the Act are certainly tribunals, if not courts, and they function within the territories of Himachal Pradesh. 
 Therefore, article 297 (1) read with article 241 confers on the court of the Judicial Commissioner power of superintendence over such tribunals. The words in relation to which obviously qualify the word territories and not the words courts and tribunals. Re. 2.The material part of article 227 substantially reproduces the provisions of section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, except that the power of superintendence has been extended by the article also to tribunals.
In this connection it has to be remembered that section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, was reproduced in the Government of India Act, 1935, as section 224. Section 224 of the 1935 Act, however, introduced sub-section (2), which was new, providing that nothing in the section should be construed as giving the High Court any jurisdiction to,question any judgment of any inferior court which was not otherwise subject to appeal or revision. The idea presumably was to nullify the effect of the decisions of the different High Courts referred to above. Section 224 of the 1935 Act has been reproduced with certain modifications in article 227 of the Constitution.

1954_13,"The learned Judges of the High Court have also very -rightly observed in their order under section 476 that they were not expressing any opinion on the guilt or innocence of the appellants. We were informed at the hearing that two further sets of proceedings arising out of the same facts are now, pending against the appellants. One is two civil suits for damages for wrongful confinement. The other,is two criminal prosecutions under section 344, Indian Penal Code, for wrongful confinement, one against each Sub-Inspector. It was said that the simultaneous prosecution of these, matters will embarrass the accused. But after the hearing of the appeal we received information that the two criminal prosecutions have been closed with liberty to file fresh complaints when the papers are ready, as the High Court records were not available on the application of the accused As these prosecutions are not pending at the moment, the objection regarding them does not arise but we can see that the simultaneous prosecution of the present criminal proceedings out of which this appeal arises and the civil suits will embarrass the accused. We have therefore to determine which should be stayed. As between the civil and the criminal proceedings we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should 1149 be given precedence. There is some difference of opinion in the High Courts of India on this point. No hard and fast rule ban. be laid down but we do not consider that the possibility of conflicting decisions in the civil and criminal courts is a relevant consideration. The law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for certain limited purposes, such as sentence or damages. 
 The only relevant consideration here is the likelihood of embarrassment. Another factor which weighs with us is that a civil suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a criminal prosecution should wait till everybody concerned has forgotten all about the crime. The public interests demand that criminal justice should be swift and sure that the guilty should be punished while the events are still fresh in the public mind and that the innocent should be absolved as early as is consistent with a fair and impartial trial. Another reason is that it is undesirable to let things glide till memories have grown too dim to trust. This,however, is not a hard and fast rule. Special considerations obtaining in any particular case might make some other course more expedient and just. For example, the civil case or the other criminal proceeding may be so hear its end as to make it inexpedient to stay it in order to give precedence to a prosecution order of under section 476. But in this case we are of the view that the civil suits should be stayed till the criminal proceedings have finished.",0,1,M   S SHERIFF,THE STATE OF MADRAS AND OTHERS
1954_114,"In this connection, it must be noted that while section 41 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 contains a prohibition against the appointment of certain persons as election agents, there is none such with, reference to the appointment of polling agents under section 46 of the Act. To hold that Government servants are, as such and as a class, disqualified to act as polling agents would be to engraft an exception to the statute, which is not there. Accordingly, we reaffirm the view taken by us that the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent does not, without more, contravene section 123(8). It is scarcely necessary to repeat our observation in the original judgment that if it is made out that the candidate or his agent had abused the right to appoint a Government servant as polling agent by exploiting the situation for furthering his election prospects, then the matter can be dealt with as an infringement of section 123(8).",0,1,SATYA DEV BUSHAHRI,PADAM DEV AND OTHERS

In another case, Petition No. 113 of 1952, decided on 28th July, 1953, the majority of the Bombay Tribunal, decided otherwise. The view of the majority was that the mandatory nature of the provisions of section 82 itself contains within it the -consequence of dismissal for non-compliance with its provisions and a separate provision for the dismissal of the petition for non-compliance with its provisions was not necessary and it would have been superfluous. These observations run counter to the scheme of the Act itself as envisaged by section 85. The provisions of sections 81, 83 and 117 are also mandatory and still in section 85 it is provided in specific terms that the Election Commission shall dismiss the petition if it is not in accordance with the provisions of those sections. 
 The, tribunal is given a similar power by section 90 (4). The member of the tribunal who dissented from the majority view gave cogent and sound reasons for holding that non- joinder of a duly nominated candidate who has withdrawn was not necessarily fatal to the petition. In Election Petition No. 83 of 1952 decided by the Election Tribunal presided over by Shri B. C. Vakil, the tribunal took the view that such a defect was fatal. A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Special Civil Appeal No. 2017 of 1952, decided on the 19th of December, 1952, allowed even a defective verification to be amended. It is not necessary to express any final opinion on matters specifically covered by sections 81, 83 and 117 and dealt with by section 85 of the Act but at the same time it is not possible to accept the view that in spite of the provisions of section 85 failure to comply strictly with the provisions of section 82 has, the same consequences as are contained in section 85. In our opinion the determination of the question whether the parties to the petition have been properly impleaded is a matter not for the Election Commission but for the tribunal. Various provisions of the Act referred to above show that the election petition does not necessarily abate or fail by reason of the death of the petitioner or any of the respondents or by their ceasing to take any interest in the trial of the petition once that petition has been referred to the tribunal.",0,0,JAGAN NATH,JASWANT SINGH AND OTHERS
1954_158,"The position therefore is that if there is no necessity in fact or if the alienee could not prove that he made bona fide enquiries and was satisfied about its existence, the transfer is undoubtedly not void but the transferee would get only the widows estate in the property which does not affect in any way the interest of the reversioner. In this case the alienation was by way of mortgage. The finding of both the Courts below is that there was no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond. The mortgagee also could not prove that there was representation of the legal necessity and that she satisfied herself by bona fide enquiries that such necessity did exist. On this point the, finding recorded by the High Court is as follows 
 In the present case, there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity, for as I have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce Suhasini to forbear from proceeding against Mohini, that the bond was being executed. There is no representation in the bond that the alienation was made with a view to securing any benefit to the estate or to avert any danger to the estate or for the purpose of any other legal necessity. Whatever enquiries the appellants may have made (1) 6 M.I.A, would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of Rashmoni. In our opinion the view taken by the High Court is quite proper. On this finding the security bond could operate only on the widows estate of Rashmoni and it was that interest alone which passed to the purchase. at the mortgage sale. The subsequent transferee could not claim to have acquired any higher right than what his predecessor had and it is immaterial whether he bona fide paid the purchase money or took proper legal advice.",0,0,KALISHANKER DAS AND ANOTHER,DHIRENDRA NATH PATRA AND OTHERS

No one can doubt the correctness of the proposition in these cases, but from an equitable right to compel the transferor to give up the dividend to the transferee, to a claim to the dividend by him as a shareholder against the company is a wide jump. In so far as the company is concerned, it does not even issue the certificate under s. 20 of the Income-tax Act in the name of an unregistered transferee but only in the name of the transferor whom it recognises, because his name is borne on its books. Section 20 lays down The principal officer of every company shall, at the time of distribution of dividends, furnish to every person receiving a dividend a certificate to the effect that the company has paid or will pay income-tax on the profits which are being distributed, and specifying such other particulars as may be prescribed. The meaning of s. 20 as also of s. 18(5) is clear if they are read with s. 19A, under which information regarding dividends has to be supplied by the company when demanded by the Income-tax Officer.
 It lays down The principal officer of every company shall, on or before the 15th day of June in each year, furnish to the prescribed officer a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner of the names and of the addresses, as entered in the register of shareholders maintained by the company, of the shareholders to whom a dividend or aggregate dividends exceeding Such amount as may be prescribed in this behalf has or have been, distributed during the, preceding year and of the amount so distributed to each such shareholder.

This takes us immediately to the register of members, and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the Indian Income- tax Act, the words ,member and shareholder can be read as synonymous. The words of s. 18(5) must accordingly be read in the light in which the word shareholder has been used in the subsequent sections, and read in that manner, the present assessee, notwithstanding the equitable right to the dividend, was not entitled to be regarded as a shareholder for the purpose of s. 18(5) of the Act.",0,0,MESSRS	 HOWRAH TRADING CO LTD,THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOMETAX CALCUTTA
1959_26,"The respondents at all material times were non-residents carrying on business at Secunderabad which was then in the territories of the Nizam of Hyderabad. They acted as agents for the supply of gas plants manufactured by Messrs. T. V. S. Iyengar Sons, Madura, to the Nizams Government, and also as agents of the Lucas Indian Services, Bombay branch, for the supply of certain goods to that Government. The year of assessment is 1945-46. There does not appear to have been any written agreement between the two manufacturers and the respondents but the goods were to be supplied on a commission basis. In pursuance of this agreement the respondents received from M s. T.V.S. lyengar Sons, Madura, cheques drawn on the Imperial Bank of India, Madras, amounting to Rs. 35,202 in respect of all goods supplied from -Madura and also from Lucas Indian Services, Bombay, by cheques drawn on Imperial Bank of India, Bombay branch, amounting to Rs. 5,302 in respect of goods supplied by them, thus making a total of Rs. 40,504. These cheques were sent by post and when received by the respondents at Secunderabad were credited in the account books of the respondents and sent to their banker G. Raghunathmal for collecting and crediting to the account of the respondents. As against these sums so deposited the respondents at once drew cheques and thus operated on these amounts deposited. In regard to the commission received from the Bombay firm it was paid into the account on December 22, 1944, but was given credit for only on January 2, 1945. The Income-tax Officer assessed these sums as taxable income holding that the entire amount of Rs. 40,504 was received in British India and not at Secunderabad. An appeal was taken by the respondents to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who upheld the order holding that income must be held to have accrued, arisen or received in British India.
 Against this order the respondents took an appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and it was held that the amounts were received by the respondents from Madura and Bombay firms as commission but they were received at Secunderabad. The appeal was therefore allowed. The finding Of the Appellate Tribunal in their own words was- The contention of the Appellants is that the cheques being negotiable instruments and the creditor having accepted them and passed through their books, II the receipt must be taken to be receipts in Hyderabad. We agree with the view submitted by the appellants.
It was further contended that in this case there was an express agreement that the payment was to be made at Secunderabad and therefore the matter does not fall within the rule in Ogale Glass Works case (1) and the following principle laid down in judgment by Das, J. (as he then was), is inapplicable - Applying the above principles to the facts found by the Tribunal the position appears to be this. The engagement of the Government was to make payment by cheques.

1959_66,"The award made by the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, in Reference (IT) No. 75 of 1956 between the appellant and the respondents whereby the Industrial Tribunal awarded to the respondents 4 1/2 months basic wages as bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending June 30, 1955). The appellant is a subsidiary of the Premier Construction Co., Ltd., and manufactures Hume Pipes.
It was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected by the appellant and only a sum of Rs. 1,23,138 - which was the actual sum paid to those workmen should be taken into account and no more. We are afraid, we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures.
 If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the Tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances-an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The Tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an All-India basis. By our order dated April 12, 1957, the appellant was ordered to pay to the respondents within a fortnight from the date thereof bonus for the year 1954-55 equivalent to two months basic wages that amount has already been paid and works out at Rs. 3.39 lacs on an All-India basis. The only question which therefore survives is what further bonus, if any, would the respondents be entitled to from the distributable surplus of Rs. 12 lacs. The sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all-engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of necessity be taken into consideration while arriving at the ultimate figure, particularly because such redemption of the debentures would enure not only for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders but also of the workmen employed therein. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we feel that an award of four months basic wages as aggregate bonus for the year 1954-55 (which by the way was the bonus awarded for the previous year 1953-54 also) would give a fair share to the labour in the distributable surplus, leaving to the shareholders and the company a balance of Rs. 5.22 lacs to be utilised by them not only towards building up of the debenture redemption reserve but also for building up other reserves, which would be utilised for various other purposes indicated above.",1,1,THE INDIAN HUME PIPE CO LTD,THEIR WORKMEN
1959_76,"This is for facilitating the purpose of the Code but it does not mean that the other persons in whose favour the occupancy is relinquished cease to have any right. That their right as occupants remains is clearly recognised by the opening paragraph of the section which gives an occupant a right to relinquish his occupancy either absolutely or in favour of a specified person. This right is given to all occupants, if there are more than one, for the singular includes the plural. It is true that where there are more occupants than one, the notice of relinquishment on behalf of any occupant must be given by the registered occupant. That does not mean, in the absence of any specific pleading and cogent proof, that a notice of relinquishment given by the registered occupant must necessarily be a notice on behalf of all occupants or any particular occupant other than the registered occupant, or that the registered occupant has the right to give such a notice without reference to the other occupants so as to effect their interest in the occupancy.
 Turning to the Rajinama, it is clear that Shiddappa did not purport to file, the same on behalf of Annappa nor had he any right to do so by reason only of his being the registered occupant. In Lalchand Sakharam Marwadi v. Khendu Kedu Ughade (1) one out of four brother mortgagors, who was the registered occupant of the mortgage land, passed a Rajinama of the land in favour of the mortgagee, who executed a Kabuliyat for the same. The remaining three mortgagors sued to redeem the mortgage alleging that the Rajinama passed by their brother conveyed only his interest and nothing more. It was held that though the conveying brother was a co-mortgagor with the plaintiffs, he had no right to sell their interest in the equity of redemption and that, so far as they, were concerned, he was in the same position as an outsider. It is true that no specific reference was made in the judgment to s. 74 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, but the actual decision in that case, the facts of which are very similar to those of the instant case, quite clearly indicates the courts understanding of the law applicable to those facts and that law was nothing but the provisions of s. 74 of the Code. In our opinion, on a correct interpretation of s. 74, where there are more occupants than one in respect of the same occupancy each occupant has his own rights and the fact of registration of one of them as the registered occupant attracts the operation of the Code and confers certain rights or imposes certain obligations on the registered occupant as laid down in the Code but does not take away the rights of other occupants.
 It is true that if any of the occupants other than the registered occupant desires to relinquish his occupancy. he cannot himself give a notice of relinquishment but must give it by and through the registered occupant Nevertheless the registered occupant, in the absence of any authority, express or implied, to be clearly pleaded and strictly proved, has no inherent or independent (1) 22 Bom L.R. 1431, right to give any such notice so as to affect the interests of the other occupants.",0,0,LILACHAND TULJARAM GUJAR AND OTHERS,MALLAPPA TUKARAM BORGAVI AND OTHERS
1959_134,"The suit was filed by the present appellants for a declaration of their title to 136 odd bighas of Ryotikasht lands and for possession thereof either exclusively or jointly with the defendants. A claim for mesne profits and interest was also made. The suit was decreed by the Subordinate Judge, Motihari, on the ground that the defendants were in possession of the suit lands as benamidars.
The correct position in law, in our opinion, is that what one has to see is whether the illegality goes so much to the root of the matter that the plaintiff cannot bring his action without relying upon the illegal transaction into which he had entered. If the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated by Williston and the plaintiff is not required to rest his case upon that illegality, then public policy demands that the defendant should not be allowed to take advantage of the position. A strict view, of course, must be taken of the plaintiffs conduct, and he should not be allowed to circumvent the illegality by resorting to some subterfuge or by mis-stating the facts. If, however, the matters is clear and the illegality is not required to be pleaded or proved as part of the cause of action and the plaintiff recanted before the illegal purpose was achieved, then, unless it be of such a gross nature as to outrage the conscience of the Court, the plea of the defendant should not prevail.
 We must remember that benami transactions are common in India, and have always been recognised. They are entered into for a variety of reasons, and the benamidar holds the property in trust for his principal. In the present case, the object of the benami transaction was merely to keep the property from being resumed by the Bettiah Raj on the expiry of the lease in favour of Radhumal, which undoubtedly the Bettiah Raj could have done, if it had been so minded. The information about the benami transaction was, however, not withheld from the Bettiah Raj, and even with that knowledge, the Bettiah Raj took no action against Radhumal or the benamidars. The plaintiffs recanted inasmuch as they asserted their true title and true facts before the occasion for the Raj to act arose. Thus, the fraud, though intended, was not perpetrated, because the fraud could only be effected at the end of the lease term, and the locus poenitentiae which the lessee possessed was duly used long before the expiry of the lease. The illegality was also of a trivial character, inasmuch as the signatures of Prahlad Rai and others were made on the relative documents on the faith of their close friendship and relationship and under the assumption that no objection from them would proceed to the making of the application on their behalf and to the signing of the B. H. forms in their names. The appellants were not required to prove this fact as part of their cause of action, and indeed, if the answering respondents are to be believed, they asserted as vehemently that the signatures were not forged but were their very own. In establishing the benami nature of a transaction, the cardinal point to be proved is the source of money and this was done, and it was also established that Prahlad Rai and others were merely farzidars. To prove these things, it did not require the proof of the signatures.",1,1,Kedar Nath Motani And Ors.,Prahlad Rai And Ors.
1959_189,"Directed against the refusal by the High Court of Patna to require the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer to it the question of law namely Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case, the amount of Rs. 1,30,785 being the excess of sale proceeds of the building, plant and machinery over the written down value of the business of the said newspapers publications could in law be termed to be income, profits and gains of the petitioner ?
The High Court as stated above declined to do so, and hence this appeal. Mr. Kolah appearing on behalf of the appellant has urged before us that the question whether the sum of Rs. 1,30,785 being the excess of the sale proceeds of the building, plant and machinery amounted to or could be deemed to be income, profits or gains of the appellant was a question of law and the High Court should have directed the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer the said question to it for its decision. Reliance was placed by him on Doughty v. Commissioner of Taxes, Commissioner of Income-tax v. Sir Homi Mehtas Executors, and Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax and it was urged that the question whether there was a sale by the appellant to the newly floated private limited company which according to his submission was in no manner distinct and separate from the appellant himself and whether profits earned by the appellant in the matter of the said transaction of the transfer of the assets from himself as the proprietor to the newly floated private limited company as the transferee could be profits or gains in the real and commercial sense of the term was really a question of law and if regard be had to the observations of this court in the majority judgment in Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax that it was open to the court to lift the veil of corporate entity and look behind the same in order to see who were the real parties to the transaction, the present case would really come within the dictum that no man can make profit from himself.
 We are at present not concerned to express any opinion on the merits of this contention. Suffice it to say that this contention raises a question of law which should have been referred to the High Court by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal for its decision, and when on the refusal of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and to refer the said question to the High Court the appellant approached the High Court, the High Court should, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, have asked the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer the said question to it for its decision.

As regards these orders the appellants contend that they run counter to the pronouncements of this Court in Punjab National Bank Ltd. v. Sri Ram Kanwar, Industrial Tribunal, Delhi (1). This contention, we are bound to say, is correct. Whatever might have been said in support of the view taken by the Tribunals in ordering payment of these allowances and of granting special leave to workmen attending proceedings of necessity, if the question was res integra we are bound by the authority of Punjab National Banks Case (1) to (1) 1957 S.C.R. 220. hold that no such allowances are payable and no such order garanting leave may be made. The order of the Tribunals below allowing travelling allowance and balting allowance and special leave to workmen attending proceedings of necessity, must therefore be set aside.
Nor is it clear from the materials on the record that unskilled workmen employed in a particular factory consider themselves attached to, that factory. It appears to be clear that once the season is over the unskilled workmen cease to have any contractual relations with the employers and may rejoin on the com- mencement of the season or may not rejoin at their sweet will. As regards the observations of the Tribunal that seasonal employees are entitled to the benefit of provident fund, gratuity and also bonus which shows that in fact their connection with the employers is not broken the materials on the record Are too scanty for arriving at any definite conclusion. In consideration of the nature and extent of the materials on the record we are of opinion that for alleviating the distress of unskilled workmen in these sugar factories, with whom we are concerned in the present appeals a much better course will be to raise the wage structure with an eye to this fact that for a part of the off season at least when they remain unemployed than to pay a retaining allowance for the entire off season.
 The appellants counsel readily agrees that the fact that these unskilled workmen find employment in the sugar factories only for a few months and are in comparative difficulty in the matter of finding employment during the remaining months, should be taken into consideration in fixing their wages. We are informed that a Wage Board entrusted with the task of fixing the wages of the workmen concerned in these disputes is sitting at the present time. The interests of both the employers and labour will, we think, be best served if instead of confirming the order made by the Appellate Tribunal as regards the retaining allowance the workmen will raise this question of raising their wages in view of the seasonal nature of their employment before this Wage Board.",0,0,MIS  ROHTAS SUGAR LTD  OTHERS,THEIR WORKMEN

 In our opinion the connection of the appellant is well founded. The Tribunal has found after going into all the documents including the document containing the words to maintain her status and dignity and the letter of the appellants husband to Mr. Buch which mentioned the word Abru that the grant of the village was by way of maintenance and merely because the appellants relations wanted a face-saving device by splitting up the total amount payable per year it would not change the nature of the transaction nor would it change the grant of maintenance made to the appellant into something else.
 The grant of the village was as much by way of maintenance as was the cash allowance called Jiwai. Maintenance must vary according to the position and status of a person. It does not only mean food and raiment. The appellant was the wife of a ruling prince and at the time the grant of the village was made, she was the Raj Mata and therefore neither the use of the words status and dignity nor the reference to ancient usage could in any way change the nature of the grant. It is true that the appellant was anxious to retain the village because that gave her the satisfaction of having agricultural land which would be a tangible asset providing her a sure source of income but, merely because she wanted the village and in the resolution of March 30, 1950, mention is made of a sum an lieu of income from the village, the nature of the grant which in this case was by way of maintenance would not change.
 The question which was referred to the High Court was whether there was material to hold that the sum of Rs. 35,807 was maintenance allowance, but the High Court reformulated this question and after going into various documents it came to a conclusion different from that of the Tribunal and it reversed the findings of the Tribunal and answered the question in a manner suggestive of an appellate rather than advisory jurisdiction.",1,1,Her Highness Maharani ...,"Commissioner Of Income-Tax, ..."
1960_44,"These appeals are directed against three judgments and orders of the Punjab High Court in three Civil Revisions Nos. 166-D, 167-D and 168-D which were brought by the appellants against three of their tenants under s. 35 of the Delhi Ajmer Rent Control Act (XXXVIII of 1952), hereinafter termed the Act. The appellants in all the three appeals are the landlords and the respondents in the three appeals are three different tenants. The appellants filed three separate suits for the eviction of their three tenants under cl. (g) of proviso to s. 13(1) of the Act on the ground that the premises were bona fide required for purposes of rebuilding. On February 27, 1953, the parties in all the three suits entered into a compromise in the following terms We have compromised the case with the plaintiff. A decree may be passed for Rs. 82/8/- on account of rent in suit and for ejectment in respect of the shop in suit in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants The defendants will vacate the shop by 4-3-53 and hand over possession to the plaintiff and the plaintiff will hand over its possession again (second time) to the defendants within six months from 4-3-53 after constructing it afresh.
It was submitted that although the time for giving delivery to the appellants was fixed in the compromise it was not of the essence of the contract. In our opinion the contentions raised by the appellants are well founded and the appellants must succeed. The suits for eviction were brought within the framework of the Act and were based on the provisions of s. 13, proviso (g). No eviction would have been possible excepting when conditions laid down in s. 13 were satisfied. The decrees which were passed were substantially in accordance with the provisions of s. 15 of the Act and as was contended by the appellants they were decrees under which the premises had to be vacated by the respondents on a specified day. Under that section they had the right to elect and did elect to get possession after rebuilding this possession was to be given by the landlords to the tenants within a reasonable time and six months period was fixed by Consent between the parties and the rent, if the respondents were not put into possession on the same terms as before, was to be settled by court and that is what was done under the terms of the consent decree. The applications for being put into possession which were filed by the respondents were really under s. 15(3) of the Act.
 As the respondents did not deli- ver possession to the appellants on or before the dates specified in the decree the provisions of s. 15 contained in sub-s. (3) of that Act were not available to them and they were ,not entitled to be put into possession as prayed by them. It was argued that the appellants had taken possession of the premises after the specified date without protest and had even accepted rent upto then and were therefore estopped from raising that defence.",1,1,RAM NATH AND ANOTHER,Ms  RAM NATH CHHITTAR MAL AND	 OTHERS
1960_72,"The short question of law which falls to be decided in the present appeal is whether a dispute raised by the employees of a General Insurance Company against their employer for payment of bonus in any particular year can be referred for adjudication by an Industrial Tribunal under S. 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (XIV of 1947).
Payment of bonus by insurers was intended by the legislature to be conditioned by the provisions contained in the said clause, and we feel no doubt or difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the intervention of the Industrial Tribunals was intended to be excluded and the matter was intended to be kept within the discretion of the Central Government so far as the payment of bonus by the insurers is concerned.
 Then, as to the argument that the Government directive issued under proviso (vii) may not be obeyed by any insurer, we do not think that such an event is likely to happen but theoretically it is conceivable that an insurer may refuse to comply with the decision of the Government. In that case all we can say is that there is a lacuna left and the legislature may consider whether it is necessary to provide adequate remedy for making the Government decision binding and final. Having regard to the unqualified and absolute prohibition contained in s. 31A(1)(c) it seems to us difficult to hold that the payment of bonus to the employees of Insurance Companies is not absolutely conditioned by proviso (vii). In the absence of the said provision no bonus could have been claimed by Insurance employees, and so the effect of the said provision must be to limit the said right to the conditions prescribed by it. That is why we think that the Tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the reference made by the Central Government is invalid. The fact that the Central Government took the view that it could make such a reference 1001 is hardly relevant in determining the scope and effect of the relevant provisions of the Act. This question must be considered on what we regard to be the fair construction of the relevant statutory provision, and as we have just indicated the construction of the relevant provision clearly supports the view taken by the Tribunal.
 Incidentally, it may be pointed out that in its award the Tribunal has referred to several other decisions of Industrial Tribunals which have taken the same view though there are one or two decisions which have upheld the validity of the reference without duly considering the effect of s. 31A(1). In this connection we may refer to the decision of this court in The Central Bank of India v. Their Workmen (1), where a similar question has been considered. In that case the Court had to consider the effect of s. 10 of the Banking Companies Act, 1949, prior to its amendment in 1956. The said section, according to that decision, prohibited the grant of industrial bonus to bank employees inasmuch as such bonus is remuneration which takes the form of a share in the profits of a banking company. In dealing with the character of bonus in relation to remuneration specified by s. 10, S. 
 Das, J., who spoke for the Court, observed that bonus in the industrial sense as understood in our country does come out of the available surplus gap, wholly or in the actual wage. id it fills the wage and age in that sense, whether it be called contingent or supplementary.",0,0,WORKMEN OF THE HERCULES INSURANCE CO LTD,HERCULES INSURANCE CO LTD CALCUTTA
1960_87,"The main consideration which influenced the tribunal in passing the order which it did was that in the view of the tribunal Ramkrishna Prasad was superseded by Babulal Parekh who was first appointed as a clerk under him. This view of I.L.R. 1955 MYS. 546. (2) 1960 2 S.C.R. 982. the tribunal in our opinion is patently erroneous. The appointment order dated October 4, 1952, clearly shows that Babulal Parekh was appointed as store inches from the very beginning at Rs. 180 per month. The tribunal referred to certain entries in the attendance register to hold that Babulal Parekh worked as clerk to begin with.
 It appears from the attendance register for the months of October, November and December that Babulal Parekh was marked present from October 7 to November 9. Thereafter from November 11 to the end of December he signed the attendance register. The statement of Cbaudhari, Labour Welfare Officer of the mill was that the practice in the mill was that officers used to be marked present in the attendance register while clerks used to sign it themselves. The tribunal has concluded from the fact that Babulal. Parekh signed the register in November that he must have been a clerk to begin with. The tribunal, however, completely overlooked that from October 7 to November 9, Babulal Parekh was marked present which would show that he was not a clerk.
 The tribunal also overlooked that even from November 28 to the end of December when Babulal Parekh admittedly was not a clerk but store in- charge he still signed the register, though he should have been marked present. Chaudhari was unable to explain how this happened, but he was hardly the person to explain this. It is, however, clear from this confusion that no importance can be attached to whether Babulal Parekh was marked present in the register or signed it. The real thing which determined the status of Babulal Parekh was the appointment order dated October 4, 1952, which the tribunal has accepted as correct. A question was certainly put to Chaudhari at the end of his cross-examination that he had manufactured the statements put in by him only the night before but he denied it. We cannot accept the suggestion on behalf of the respondents that the appointment order was ante-dated, for no such suggestion was made to Chaudhari and the tribunal itself does not find so. It is clear therefore that the finding of the tribunal that Babulal Parekh was appointed as clerk under Ramkrishna Prasad to begin with is patently perverse and it must be held that Babulal Parekh was from the very beginning working as store in-charge. Now in so far as Ramkrishna Prasad was concerned his work and emoluments remained the same after the appointment of Babulal Parekh. If a higher post was created in the Stores Department because of the increase in work, Ramkrishna Prasad could not claim promotion to it merely because he was working as a store-keeper before.",1,0,MANAGEMENT OF VISHNU SUGAR MILLS LIMITEDHARKHUA DISTRICT,THEIR WORKMEN REPRESENTED BY CHINI MILL MAZDOOR UNIONHARKHU
1960_100,"The brief facts necessary for present purposes are that the appellant was appointed as a foot- constable in 1931 in the Punjab Police and was dismissed on January 25, 1944. Shortly before, he was acting as an Assistant Sub-Inspector and actually working as a Police Censor. The charge against him was that while he was working as Police Censor, he detained certain letters illegally and had copies and photo- graphs made of them and later used these copies and photographs for blackmail. He was consequently reverted to his substantive post of head constable on January 14, 1944. Thereafter on January 21, 1944, an enquiry was started against him by the Superintendent of Police and he was eventually dismissed. He went in appeal to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, which was dismissed. He then went in revision to the Inspector General of Police, which also failed.
Section 243 however is in these terms- Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, the conditions of service of the subordinate ranks of the various police forces in India shall be such as may be determined by or under the Act relating to those forces respectively. Obviously s. 243 was a special provision with regard to subordinate ranks of police forces in India and it is not in dispute that the appellant belonged to the subordinate ranks. Therefore according to s. 243, the conditions of service of the subordinate ranks are governed by or under the Acts relating to police forces and s. 240(3) can have no application to them. The non obstante clause of s. 243 makes it clear that so far as the subordinate ranks of police forces in India are concerned, a. 243 will apply and not the earlier provisions including s. 240(3). We are therefore of opinion that in view of the special provisions in s. 243 relating to the subordinate ranks of police forces in India (to which the appellant undoubtedly belonged), s. 240(3) would have no application.
 We may in this connection refer to the judgment of the Privy Council in North- West Frontier Province v. Suraj Narain Anand (1), where it was held that the non obstante clause in s. 243 excluded the operation of s. 240(2) in the case of subordinate ranks of police forces in India and that conditions of service included the right of dismissal. (1) 1948 F.C.R. 103. That case dealt with s. 240(2) but the same reasoning would in our opinion apply to s. 240(3). As has already been pointed out by the learned District Judge, the substance of s. 240(3) was brought into the Police Regulations in September 1946 long after the appellant had been dismissed and would therefore not apply to the appellant. He would therefore not be entitled to the second notice under s. 240(3) as explained in I. M. Lalls case by the Privy Council (See High Commissioner for India High Commissioner for Pakistan v. I. M. Lall (1)). Nor was such notice necessary under the Police Regulations as they existed at the time of the appellants dismissal.",0,0,BHAGAT SINGH,THE STATE OF PUNJAB
1960_103,"gainst the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras allowing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The question there raised was the legality of the assessment of Sales Tax by appellant No. 2, the Deputy Commercial Sales Tax Officer, Saidapet, under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 (Act IX of 1939), hereinafter termed the Act. The respondent was a partnership firm carrying on tannery business at Chromepet near the city of Madras. Before the year of assessment, i. e., 1952-53, it was taking out licences under the relevant provisions of the Act but it did not renew the licence for the assessment year. When called upon to make a return it did not do so nor did it raise any objection to the notice served on it on February 28, 1954. It was assessed to sales tax of Rs. 10,584 on a turnover of Rs. 6,77,374-4-4. It filed a petition under Art. 226 to quash the assessment order on the ground that the order was illegal and not supported by the authority of law. This contention was accepted by the High Court and the petition was allowed with costs. The consequence of the judgment is that the respondent firm which is not a licensed dealer under the Act is not liable to any sales tax in respect of its dealings in hides and skins.
This, it appears, was not disputed by the Government and it was therefore held that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules was ultra vires. But the question was really (1) (1952) 3 S.T.C. 367. V. M. Syed Mohammed and Company v. The State of Andhra, 1954 S.C.R. 1117. not relevant to the issue as was pointed out by Venkatarama Ayyar, J., at p. 394, where he said- Now the contention of the petitioners is that where there are sales by unlicensed dealers to unlicensed tanners or unlicensed dealers, there is the possibility of multiple taxation and that would be in violation of section 5(vi). It is not disputed on behalf of the Government that Rule 16(5) is repugnant to section 5(vi).
 It must therefore be held to be ultra vires. But this can bring no relief to the petitioners, as they are all licensed tanners and are in no manner hurt by the operation of r. 16(5). This was conceded by the learned Advocate for the petitioners . This case was then brought in appeal to this Court and S. R. Das, J. (as he then was), observed at p. 1121- Lastly, the learned advocate urges that rule 16 (5) clearly contravenes the provisions of section 5(vi) of the Act. This sub-rule has been held to be ultra vires by the High Court, and indeed, the learned Advocate General of Madras did not in the High Court, as before us, dispute that rule 16(5) was repugnant to ,section 5(vi). That sub-rule, however affects only unlicensed dealers and the appellants who are admittedly licensed dealers are not affected by that sub-rule .",1,1,THE STATE OF MADRAS AND ANOTHER,Ms  M A NOOR MOHAMMED AND CO
1960_265,"The State of Kerala and the Tahsildars of Kottayam and Kanjirappally Taluks are the appellants, and C.M. Francis Co., a partnership firm, is the first respondent, and the partners of the firm are the remaining respondents. The respondents were doing business in hill produce like pepper, ginger, betelnuts etc., and were assessed to sales tax under the Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act XI of 1125 (referred to as the Act), for the years 1950 to 1954. The respondents have to pay a sum of Rs. 1,01,716-4-3 as tax. In 1954, proceedings were started against them under s. 13 of the Act, which provides that if the tax is not paid as laid down in that section, the whole of the amount or such part thereof as remains due, may be recovered as if it were an arrears of land revenue. It appears that the pro- ceedings were not fruitful, and a prosecution under s. 19 of the Act was instituted against the partners in the Court of the First Class Magistrate, Ponkunnam. Respondents 2 to 5 pleaded guilty, and the Magistrate passed an order on October 18, 1955 as follows The sentence or other final order A 1 to 4 sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 50/- each and in default to undergo S. 1. for one month each.
In dealing with the question, the learned Judges of the High Court felt that s. 13 of the Act was in the nature of a general law, over which the special procedure prescribed by s. 19 of the Act read with s. 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was to prevail. They, however, thought that, since all the processes available under s. 19 of the Act were also available under s. 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was not necessary to decide what would happen if the proceedings under s. 386 came to nothing. They observed that if the question arose, they would consider it.
 The writ of prohibition was granted by the High Court. The respondents did not appear in this Court. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, who has drawn our attention to all the relevant provisions of the law. The question which arises is whether s. 19 must be taken to prevail over s. 13 of the Act. Both the sections lay down the mode for recovery of arrears of tax, and, as has already been noticed by the High Court, lead to the application of the process for recovery by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties, belonging to the tax-evader. It cannot be said that one proceeding is more general than the other, because there is much that is common between them, in so far as the mode of recovery is concerned. Section 19, in addition to recovery of the amount, gives the power to the Magistrate to convict and sentence the offender to fine or in default of payment of fine, to imprisonment.",1,1,STATE OF KERALA AND OTHERS,C   M FRANCIS  CO
1960_327,"he appellant is the U. P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd., Lucknow, (hereinafter called the company). It appears that the company used to employ Messrs. s M. Choudhary (hereinafter referred to as the contractors) as its contractors for doing certain work for it. The contractors in their turn used to employ a number of persons to carry out the work which they had taken on contract. A dispute arose between the contractors and their workmen in 1956 and an application was made on June 6, 1956, by the workmen before the conciliation board.
The tribunal went into the evidence in this connection and came to the conclusion that these workmen were in fact and in reality the employees of the company. The main contention on behalf of the company before us is that even assuming that the Government had power under s. 5 read with cl. 12 of G. O. No. U-464 (LL)XXXVI-B- 257(LL)/1954, dated July 14, 1954, to implied the company as a party, the main issue decided by the tribunal was not referred to it and the tribunal could only decide the three matters of dispute included in the order of reference of July 31, 1956. Therefore, in so far as the tribunal went beyond the, three matters of dispute specified in the reference and decided the question whether the workmen concerned were in the employ of the company or of the contractors it was acting without jurisdiction as this matter was never referred to it. We are of opinion that this contention must prevail. As we have already pointed out, there were four matters before the conciliation board including the question of non-abolition of the contract system. Further before the conciliation board not only the contractors but the company was also a party, for obviously the question of non-abolition of the contract system would necessitate the presence of the company as a party to the proceedings.
 When however the Government referred the dispute to the tribunal on July 31, it did not include the fourth item which was before the conciliation board relating to the non-abolition of the contract system among the matters in dispute. It also did not include the company as one of the parties to the dispute, for the reference-order refers only to two parties to the dispute, namely, the contractors and their workmen. On such a reference there could be no jurisdiction in the tribunal to decide the question whether these workmen were the workmen of the company or of the contractors, for such a question was not referred to the tribunal. It is true that on August 13, 1956, the company was impleaded as a party to the dispute referred by the notification of July 31 but the matters in dispute remained unmended, and the question of non-abolition of the contract system or the question whether these workmen were the employees of the company in fact and in reality was not included in the matters of dispute by amendment under the proviso to s. 4 of the Act.",1,0,Ms  U P ELECTRIC SUPPLY CO LTD,THE WORKMEN OF Ms  S N CHOUDHARYCONTRACTORS AND ANOTHER

Maheshwari, for the appellant. L. Gosain and K. L. Mehta, for the respondent. 1961. December 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.-Mr. Justice Bachawat of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta decreed Suit No. 1039 of 1948 filed by one Pearey Lal-hereinafter called the plaintiff-for a decree for Rs. 1,35,000/- with interest against the New Bank of India Ltd.
It is not necessary in this appeal to consider whether because of an agreement to pay interest the relationship may be deemed to be of debtor and creditor, because it was held by both the courts below that no such agreement is proved, and according to the settled practice of this court the finding is regarded a binding. The Bank charged no commission or remuneration for transmitting the amount to Calcutta, but that, in our judgment, is a circumstance which permits of no inference against the plaintiff. Undoubtedly, when the amount was delivered to the Bank by the plaintiff it was his intention to open fixed deposit account in Calcutta with the Banks branch but the fixed deposit accounts were to be opened after instructions were received. 
The transaction, as evidenced by the two receipts, was primarily one of entrustment of the amount to the Bank for transmission to Calcutta. After the purpose for which the moneys were entrusted was carried out, in the absence of further instructions the defendant did not cease to be a trustee. So long as instructions were not given by the plaintiff for appropriation of the amounts the Bank continued to hold the amounts transmitted for and on behalf of the plaintiff and there is no evidence that the plaintiff gave instructions or acquiesced in the opening of a fixed deposit account after the same reached Calcutta. It is immaterial that the Bank purported to open fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff with the amounts received at its head office at Lahore. That course of action was adopted without the consent of the plaintiff and it could not bind the plaintiff. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the amount delivered by the plaintiff to the Bank at Lahore remained in trust even after it reached Calcutta, and it was not held by the Bank, in deposit for the plaintiff within the meaning of the scheme sanctioned by the High Court of East Punjab.",0,1,NEW BANK OF INDIA LTD,PEAREY LAL

The Official Liquidator having informed the solicitors of the appellant that the latter were not entitled to a copy of the report of the official liquidator, the appellant applied by a judges summons for an order recalling vacating, setting aside or modifying the order dated January 18, 1960, and for a direction to the official liquidator requiring him to supply copies of the report of the official liquidator and of the other documents relating to the application and alternatively for an order granting leave to inspect the court records and proceedings of the application and to take copies thereof. The appellant contended that the order made by Mr. Justice Mitter on January 18, 1960, was obtained by suppression of material facts and that, in any event, the order made without notice to the appellant was vexatious and oppressive and amounted to an abuse of the process of Court.
Manifestly, the order could be obtained on a petition which was required to be verified by the official liquidator and there had to be a formal hearing and only if a prima facie case for hearing had been made out the order could be made. Under the Companies (Court) Rules a different practice, which approaches the practice prevailing in the English Courts has been set up. The mere fact that under r. 195 of the Calcutta High Court Rules under Act of 1913 the appellant might have had a right of access to the statement on which the order was founded will not be an adequate ground for holding that the earlier practice must continue to prevail.

1961_365,"This is an appeal with special leave under article 136 of the Constitution against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, refusing to call for a statement of case from the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The appellants are a registered firm carrying on the business of money- lending and speculation in silver and shares. The partners of the appellants firm were also partners of Messrs. Morarka Co., who were the managing agents of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. - hereinafter called the Sholapur Mills.
Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law and or acted without any evidence in finding that the investment of the assessee in the shares of the Sholapur Mills was a capital investment and not its stock-in-trade ? Whether in any event in view of the assessments made for the years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 and the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order for these three years, it was open to the department to hold for the assessment years 1949-50 that the said shares do not represent the assessees stock-in-trade ? Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law in omitting to consider certain material facts which were taken into account by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and expressly maintained in the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order, including the fact that the assessee had been holding shares in several other companies as stock- in-trade and this position has been accepted by the department although in those shares there have been preferred with special leave. In our view, the High Court was right in refusing to call for a statement of the case under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The conclusion of the Tribunal was based on inferences of fact raised from materials before the taxing authorities. The conduct of the appellants clearly indicated that even though they were dealing in shares of other companies, the shares of the Sholapur Mills were treated by them as capital investment for the purpose of maintaining their managing agency. The number of shares held by the appellants went on increasing from time to time and not a single share was ever sold. The Tribunal pointed out that the returns for the assessment years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 were filed by the appellants after they knew that there were wide fluctuations in the quotation of the shares of that company. They also referred to the circumstance that the appellants were interested in the managing agency of the Sholapur Mills and that every member of the family of the appellants was holding shares 
 The conclusion of the Tribunal was amply supported by evidence. It can not be said that because in the previous years the shares were held to be stock-in-trade, they must be similarly treated for the assessment year 1949-50. In the matter of assessment of income-tax, each years assessment is complete and the decision arrived at in a previous year on material before the taxing authorities cannot be regarded as binding in the assessment for the subsequent years. The Tribunal is not shown to have omitted to consider the material facts. The decision of the Tribunal was on a question of fact and no question of law arose which could be directed to be referred under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act.",0,0,Dwarkadas Kesardeo Morarka,"Commissioner Of Income-Tax, ..."

As already observed, the right to passage was originally made part of the salary, but under the Rules framed in 1926, the provision for setting apart a fixed sum of money as salary out of the General Passage Fund was altered and passages were credited to the account of members of Civil services and debited and when they were availed of out of the general Revenue of the State. This alteration was made merely for administrative convenience and did not alter the character of the benefit. Under the Rules of 1924, the provision for passage port of the remuneration and it continued to be such even after the amendment of the Rules in 1926 The right to passage benefits was statutory, and was under the Indian Independence Act in the nature of an allowance, or in any event privilege or facility paid in kind. It was expressly made part of the remuneration earned by the numbers of the Indian Civil Service. The Conditions of service as to remuneration having been guaranteed, the right to this benefit remained guaranteed to those members of the Indian Civil Service who were entitled to it before the Constitutions. This guarantee which was continued in force even after the Commencement of the Constitution was for the first time by Rules made in June 1957 by retrospective amendment of the Statutory Rules from July 12, 1956 sought to be cancelled. But the central Government in exercise of Rule making power was incompetent to destroy or cancel a constitutional guarantee.",0,1,THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL BIHAR AND ANOTHER,N BAKSHI

Gupta, for the appellant No. 1. Har Dayal Hardy and N. N. Keswani, for respondent No. 1. 1961. March 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.-This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and decree of the High of Judicature at Nagpur confirming the judgment of the 2nd Additional District Judge, Jabalpur in Civil Suit No. 9-A of 1942, filed by respondents 2 to 7 herein claiming to be the reversioners of the estate of one Raja Ajitsingh. Ajit Singh was the Raja of Saliya Estate consisting of 73 villages and other property situate in Jabalpur and Saugor Districts.
We, therefore, hold that on the death of the widow, the illegitimate son, the father of the first respondent herein, succeeded to the other half share of the estate of his putative father Raja Ajit Singh. It is. next contended that the widows acquired an absolute interest in the estate of Raja. Ajit Singh by adverse possession and, therefore, the property would devolve not on Raja Ajit Singhs heirs but on the heirs of the widows. On the question of adverse possession also, both the courts below have held against the appellant. But learned counsel argued that in the circumstances of this case the said find- ing was a mixed question of fact and law. It was said that the courts below missed the point that the Court of Wards, representing the widows, held the Estate adversely to Ramraghuraj Singh in respect of his half share and, therefore, the fact that during its management the widows did not deny the title of Ramraghuraj Singh or the fact that they admitted his title could not affect the question of adverse possession.
Assuming that learned counsel for the appellant was correct in his contention, we fail to see how the said legal position would advance the appellants case, for the Court of Wards admittedly managed only the I.L.R. 1938 Nag. 255. widows limited estate and it is not the case of the appellant that the Court of Wards acquired on behalf of the widows an absolute interest in respect of the half share of Ramraghuraj Singh in the suit properties. The plaintiffs themselves claimed to hereversioners of Raja Ajit Singh on the ground that the succession to him opened out when the widows died and if their contention be accepted, namely, that the widows acquired an absolute interest in half of the property, they would be non-suited in respect thereof on the simple ground that their suit was not to recover the property as the heirs of the widows. But, as we have pointed out, the widows would have acquired a title by adverse possession in respect of the share of Ramraghuraj Singh only in their capacity as owners of a limited estate i.e., in regard to their half share they held it as widows estate and in respect of the other half-share of Ramraghuraj Singh they acquired a right by adverse possession only a limited estate therein.",0,1,SINGHAL AJIT KUMAR  ANOTHER,UJAYARSINGH AND OTHERS
1962_47,"We allowed Civil Appeal No. 533 of 1960 on May 4, 1962, by our judgment dealing with the facts of the, case and giving the reasons for the opinion expressed. It is not necessary to repeat them. Suffice it to say that the appeal was allowed on the ground that the respondents bad lost their right to recover possession from the appellants on their estate vesting in the State of Bihar by virtue of se. 3 and 4 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX of 1950), hereinafter called the Act, and their having no subsisting right to recover possession from the appellants. It was also hold that they could not get advantage of the provisions of cl. (c) of sub-s. (1) of s. 6 of the Act as amended by the Bihar Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1959 (Act XVI of 1959) as no mortgage subsisted on the date of vesting.
It therefore follows that the only property which a second or other subsequent mortgagee may redeem is the property on which the first mortgagee is entitled to enforce his security. From the very necessity of things the right of redemp- tion can be exercised in respect of such pro- perty only as is subject to a mortgage capable of enforcement. There can be nothing for enforcing a mortgage when the money has been paid up and therefore the right to redeem ceases on payment of the mortgage money.
(2) A.I.R. 1946. All. 400,402. have that redemption carried out by the pro- cess of the various declarations and orders of the Court by which it effects redemption. In other words. s. 60 contemplates a cage in which the mortgage is still subsisting and the mortgagor goes to the Court to obtain the return of his property on repayment of what is still due. Section 62, on the other hand, is in marked contract to s. 60. Section 62 says that in the case of a usufructuary mortgage the mortgagor has a right to recover possession of the property when (In a case in which the mortgagee is authorised to pay himself the mortgage money out of the rents and ,profits of the property) the principal money is paid off. As we see it, that is not a case of redemption at all. At the moment when the, rents and profits of the mortgaged property sufficed to discharge the principal secured by th e mortgage, the mortgage came to an end and the correlative right arose in the mortgagor to recover possession of the property. 
The framers of the Transfer of Property Act have clearly recognised the distinction between the procedure which follows a mortgagors desire to redeem a subsisting mortgage and the procedure which follows the arising of a usufructuary mortgagors right to get his property back after the principal has been paid off. We therefore hold that the mortgage was not subsisting on the date of vesting, it having come to an end on payment of the mortgage money in 1943. and that the respondents cannot get the advantage of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act.",0,0,PRITHI NATH SINGH AND OTHERS,SURAJ AHIR AND OTHERS
1962_105,"hah, J. The High Court of Judicature at Bombay answered in the affirmative the following two questions which were referred by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, under sections 66(2) of the Income-tax Act.
 Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal was justified in law in adding to the total income of the assessee the sum of Rs. 1,45,706 and or Rs. 48,185 or any part thereof ? Whether there was any material on record to support the finding that Rs. 1,45,706 and or 48,185 or any part thereof represent the income of the assessee ?
Again the evidence of Achaldas and Poonamchand clearly showed that these amounts were repaid. In the statements made by these two persons before the Income- tax Officer it was asserted that the repayment of the amounts of the cheques was made to the assessees. 
Before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner they stated that they handed over the moneys to some other persons whose presence could not be procured. There is nothing on the record to show that the Income-tax Officer had not disclosed to the assessees the material he had collected by examining Achaldas and Poonamchand. In any event, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the interest of justice and fair play gave the assessees an opportunity to cross-examine these two persons. The Income-tax Officer is not bound by any technical rules of the law of evidence. It is open to him to collect materials to facilitates assessment even by private enquiry. But if he desires to use the material so collected, the assessee must be informed of the material and must be given an adequate opportunity of explaining it. The statements made by Achaldas and Poonamchand before the Income-tax Officer were material on which the income-tax authorities could act provided that the material was disclosed and the assessees had opportunity to render their explanation in that behalf. It was therefore open to the Tribunal in appreciating the evidence to rely upon the statements made by Achaldas and Poonamchand before the Income-tax Officer and to disbelieve the statements made by them before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The jurisdiction of the High Court under section 66 of the Income-tax Act is merely advisory. The High Court does not sit in appeal over the judgment of the income-tax authorities it is not concerned to decide whether the conclusion of the Tribunal on appreciation of evidence is correct. There was apparently a mass of evidence on which the conclusion of the Appellate Tribunal could be founded and the question which fell to be determined by it was purely one of fact. It is true that a finding of fact which is not supported by any evidence or is unreasonable and perverse may be open to challenge on the ground that it is not supported by any material on the record, but, as we have already observed, there was material on which the Income-tax Tribunal could reasonably arrive at the conclusion which it did. The High Court was, therefore, right in recording the answers to the two questions submitted to it.",0,0,C. Vasantlal And Co.,"Commissioner Of Income-Tax, ..."
1962_113,"It is against the order of the Board of Revenue that the appellant has come in appeal by special leave but has not appeared against the judgment and order of the High Court.
This Court in M s. Chimmonalall Rameshwarlall Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) Calcutta (1) held that in cases where a reference is made to the High Court and the appeal is brought only against the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal then the Supreme Court, if it interfered, would in fact be setting aside the judgment of the High Court without there being an appeal to this Court, and that this Court could not bypass the normal procedure which was to be adopted for the purpose. In a later Judgment in Chandi Prasad Chokhani v. State of Bihar (2)a similar view was taken that as the assessee had not obtained Special Leave in respect of any of the orders passed by the High Court under s. 25 those orders became final and binding and the assessee could not be allowed to bypass or go behind the orders of the High Court and such exercise would be particularly inadvisable in a case where the result may be a conflict of the decision of two courts of competent jurisdiction, which was contrary to the object of ss. 23, 24 and 25 of the Act. 
In this view of the law the appellant is not entitled to agitate the correctness or otherwise of the decision given by the Tribunal in regard to the questions which we agitated before the High Court and were decided against the appellant and against which no appeal has been brought.

1962_118,"On the 26th July, 1958, the Collector of Central Excise, Nagpur, passed an order directing absolute confiscation of five bars of gold weighing 290.6 Tolas found in the possession of the appellant Pukhraj and imposing upon him a personal penalty of Rs. 25,000/- under s. 167 (8) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 read with a. 19 of the said Act and s. 23-A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution on September 15, 1958. By this petition, the appellant claimed a writ of Certiorari or other appropriate writ or order quashing the impugned order.
The argument is that the question as to whether there was a reasonable belief or not is justiceable, and since there is no material on the record to show that the belief could have been reasonable, the statutory presumption cannot be raised. In our opinion, this argument is not well-founded. There are two broad features of this seizure which cannot be igno- red. The first feature on which the officer relied is supplied by the quantity of gold in question. It was found that the appellant was carrying on his person five pieces of gold bullion weighing as much as 290.6 tolas. 
This large quantity of gold valued at nearly Rs. 30,000/- itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be smuggled. In that connection, it may not be irrelevant to remember that the said officer had received positive information in the month of September, 1956, regarding the smuggling of gold by the appellant. That is why he was intercepted by the officer on the 25th October, 1956, at the Raigarb railway station at 16.30 hours. Then the other fact on which the reasonable belief can be founded is the suspicious circumstances of the appellants journey. The appellant was found travelling without a Railway ticket and his explanation as to how he came to be. in the said passenger train is obviously untrue. A person carrying a, large quantity of gold and found travelling without a ticket may well have raised a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold was smuggled. The object of travelling without a ticket must have been to conceal the fact that the appellant had travelled all the way from Calcutta at which place the gold must have been smuggled. The story subsequently mentioned by the appellant about his journey to Tatanagar which has been disbelieved brings into bold belief the purpose which the appellant had in mind in travelling without a ticket. After-all-, when we are dealing with a question as to whether the belief in the mind of the Officer who effected the seizure was reasonable or not, we are not sitting in appeal over the decision of the said officer. All that we can consider is whether there is ground which prima facie justifies the said reasonable belief. That being so, we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without a reasonable belief and so is outside section 178A.",0,0,PUKHRAJ,D R KOHLI
1962_128,"By a communication dated April 5, 1930, from the Secretary to the Government of the Central Provinces addressed to the Commissioner Jabalpur Division, certain Nazul land was made available to the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur. In this letter the Secretary Stated I am directed by the Governor in Council with the previous sanction of the Government of India to communicate the following orders of the Government of the Central Provinces - Under Section 38(1)(f) of the Central Provinces Municipalities Act, 1922, Government is pleased to transfer to the Municipal Committee, Jubbiilpore, free of premium and ground rent nazul land measuring of the Jabbulpore town.
In our opinion, on the allegations made in the petition by the appellant Corporation it ought not to have been permitted to put forward a case that the State Government was not the transferor of the property and the learned Judges of the High Court should have proceeded on the basis of the pleadings in the case. Apart from this question of pleading, we consider that there is no merit in the contention even otherwise. 
We have already set out the terms by which the transfer of the land was communicated to the Municipal Committee. The preamble recites that is what being communicated is the order of the Government of the Central Provinces. The words of conveyance are in the second paragraph and they read Under section 38(1)(f) of the Central Provinces Municipalities Act, 1922 Government is pleased to transfer to the Municipal Committee . The expression Government here obviously, in the context, means the Government of the Central Provinces. Paragraph 2 which specifies what should happen if the condition on which the land has been granted should be broken, states The land shall be liable to be. divested under s. 38 (2) and resumed by Government . Government here again obviously is the Government of the Central Provinces a construction reinforced if one looked at the sub-section referred to. Further, in Condition 3 which speaks of what was to happen if the land was resumed by Government for any Government purpose the reference to Government again is to the State Government. On the terms of the document therefore it was the Government of the Central Provinces that made the grant-the predecessor of the State Government. We find therefore that there is no factual foundation for the submission which was apparently made before the High Court that the transfer in the present case was by the Central Government. No doubt, the communication refers to the fact that previous to making the grant the Government of C. P. Berar had obtained the approval of the Central Government, but that was merely a matter of administrative arrangement between the Central and Local Governments which is totally irrelevant for determining the identity of the Government which made the grant. Besides, the corporation having accepted the grant from the State Government was obviously estopped from contending that the land of which it continued in possession under that grant was not one by the State Government or that the State Government had not the authority to make the grant. If such contention is both not open to the Corporation and not tenable on the merits., it would follow that the impugned notification was fully justified by the, provisions under s. 81 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act.",0,0,MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF THE  CITY OF JABALPUR,STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH
1962_207,"This appeal by special leave is against the order of the High Court at Allahabad under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The three appellants carry on the trade of auctioning vegetables. These vegetables, it appears, are brought in carts which are parked on the public road outside the building where the auctioning takes place. There was some dispute between these appellants and the Municipal Board which it is suggested by the appellants was really behind the move to get this order under s. 133 passed against them. It is unnecessary, however, for us to consider that matter. What appears to be clear is that the trade is carried on in a private house in the subzimandi quarter and it does happen that some amount of inconvenience is caused to people who pass by the public road because of the carts which necessarily come near this house. The real question is, whether because this trade of auctioning vegetables which the appellants carry on in their private house produce the consequence that people passing by the road are put to inconvenience, action can be taken under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
The High Court seems to be of the opinion - when it is clear that the business of auctioning vegetables cannot be carried on without causing obstruction to the passers by, the conduct of the business can be prohibited, even though it is carried on in a private place. It seems to us that this proposition has been put too widely. Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers action by the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Magistrate 1st class to remove public nuisances in certain circumstances.
Undoubtedly, some amount of noise the auction is going on. That however is a necessary concomitant of buying and selling large quantities and it will be unreasonable to think that merely because some amount of noise is caused which people preferring perfect peace may not like, this is injurious to the physical comfort, or health of the community. It appears to us that the conduct of trades of this nature and indeed of other trades in localities of a city where such trades are usually carried on, is bound to produce some discomfort, though at the same time resulting perhaps in the good of the community in other respects. If a trade like auctioning which has to be carried on as necessary for the well being of the community, some amount of noise has to be borne in at least that part of the town where such trade is ordinarily carried on. 
In making the provisions of s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the legislature cannot have intended the stoppage of such trades in such part of the town, merely because of the discomfort caused by the noise in carrying on the trade. In our opinion therefore, the slight discomfort that may be caused to some people passing by the road or living in the neighbourhood cannot ordinarily be considered to be such as to justify action under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We do not think that the orders are justified under s. 133.",1,0,Ram Autar,State Of U.P.
1962_213,"This appeal on a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court under Act 134(1), (c). of the Constitution, is directed against the order of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court dated December 21, 1960, setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial Magistrate, dated July 2, 1958. We heard this appeal on the eve of the long vacation and pronounced our order to the effect that the appeal was allowed and the order of acquittal was to stand, and that reasons would be given later. It appears that the appellant, who it a practising lawyer, had been employed by the respondent to work for him to investigate the title to some property which the latter was about to purchase, sometime in October 1952. The prosecution case was that the respondent had entrusted the. sum of Rs. 5000/- to the appellant for depositing in Court in connection with an application in respect of the proposed transaction, under the Bengal Money Lenders Act, and that the appellant having been so entrusted with the money, in breach of trust, misappropriated the amount, thus causing loss to his client. The appellant was, therefore, charged under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code, with having committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the sum of Rs. 5000/- , which had been entrusted to him as a lawyer on behalf of the respondent.
It is not a case where it in open to the Court of Appeal, against an order of acquittal, to order a retrial for the reasons that the trial Court has not given the prosecution full opportunity to adduce all available evidence in support of the prosecution case. It has no where been suggested that the trial Magistrate had unreasonably refused any opportunity to the prosecution to adduce all the evidence that it was ready and willing to produce. That being so, the High Court, in our judgment, entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another Magistrate, simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client. Simply because the accused happened to be a lawyer would not be a ground for subjecting him to harassment a second time, there being no reason for holding that his prosecutor had not a fair chance of bringing the charge home to him. In our opinion, the High Court gave way to considerations which were not relevant to a criminal trial. The High Court was not sitting on a disciplinary proceeding for professional misconduct. It had to apply the same rules of criminal jurisprudence as. apply to all criminal trials, and, in our opinion, the only. reason given by the High Court for ordering retrial is against all well-established rules of criminal jurisprudence. The fact that the appellant is a practising lawyer does not entitle him to any preferential treatment when he is hauled up on a criminal charge, even as he is not subject to any additional disability because the cam was between a lawyer and his client. There was no relationship of lawyer and client so far as the criminal case was concerned.",1,1,ABINASH CHANDRA BOSE,BIMAL CHANDRA BOSE
1962_339,"Only one question arises for consideration in this appeal by special leave and that is the meaning to be given to the expression final decision occurring in the first proviso to s. 28 A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 (Act No. 5 of 1920), introduced by Act No. 25 of 1948. For appreciating the argument advanced before us a few facts have to be stated. Venkata Reddy, the father of the appellants, was adjudicated an insolvent by the Sub-Court, Salem in I. P. No. 73 of 1935. At that time only the appellants 1 and 2 were born while the third appellant was born later. The fathers one-third share was put up for auction by the Official Receiver and was purchased by one Karuppan Pillai for Rs. 80/-. The Official Receiver then put up for auction the two-thirds share belonging to appellants 1 and 2 on July 27, 1936, which was purchased by the same person for Rs. 341/-. He sold the entire property to the respondent Pethi Reddy on May 25, 1939, for Rs. 300/-. The appellants instituted a suit on February 1, 1.943, for the partition of the joint family property to which suit they made Pethi Reddy a party and claimed thereunder two- thirds share in the property puchased by him. In that suit it was contended on behalf of the respondent that on their fathers insolvency the share of the appellants in the joint family property also vested in the Official Receiver and that he had the power to sell it. The contention was negatived by the trial court which passed a preliminary decree for partition in favour of the appellants.
In the case before us the preliminary decree was never challenged at all by preferring any appeal and therefore, the matters conclude by it are not open to challenge in an appeal against the final decree. Further, a preliminary decree cannot be equated with an interlocutory order within the meaning of s. 105, Code of Civil Procedure. It will thus be seen that the decision relied upon has no application to the facts of this case. Our conclusion, therefore, is that in this case the sale made by the Official Receiver during the insolvency of the appellants father was the subject of a final decision by a competent court inasmuch as that court decided that the sale was of no avail to the purchaser at the Official Receiver had no power to effect that sale. Nothing more was required to be established by the appellants before being entitled to the protection of the first proviso to s.28A. 
Since they have established what was required to be established by them, they are entitled to a final decree and the High Court was in error in dismissing their application in that behalf. In the result we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore that of the trial court as affirmed in appeal by the learned Subordinate judge. Costs in this court and in the High Court will be borne by the present respondent.",1,1,VENKATA REDDI AND OTHERS,POTHI REDDI

Daphtary, Solicitor General of India. and Sardar Bhadur, for the appellants. P. Maheshwari, for the respondents. 1962. March 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR,J.-This appeal by special leave, is directed against the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal,Patna, directing the appellant, the Tatanagar Foundry Co., to pay to the respondents, its workmen, 75 of the consolidated wages as compensation for having laid them off for a period of 45 days commencing from December 1.5, 1959. it is common around that the appellant laid off the respondents for the said period. The appellants case was that it had paid the respondents the statutory compensation for the said lay-off as prescribed by s.25C of the Industrial Disputes Act (No. 14 of 1947) (hereinafter called the Act).
That is a matter relating to the management of the undertaking and unless malafides are alleged or proved, it would be difficult to assume that the Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction to sit in judgment over the acts of management of the employer and investigate whether a more prudent management could have avoided the situation which led to lay- off. The danger involved in permitting such jurisdiction to the Tribunal is illustrated by the present award itself. The Tribunal has found that the appellant was in financial difficulties at the relevant time it has found that the appellant was not actuated by any malafide intention, it has come to the conclusion that the lay-off was not the result of any uleriort motive, and yet it has finally come to the conclusion that if the affairs of the appellant it had been better managed and more foresight had been shown by the appellant prior to the time when the crisis was reached, pig iron could have been secured and lay-off could have been avoided. Apart from, the fact that this conclusion does not appear to be borne out by any evidence on record, it seems to us that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in trying to decide whether better. management could have avoided the crisis. The appellant is, no doubt, expected to manage its affairs prudently, but it would, we think, not be reasonable or fair to hold that if the employer is faced with a situation under which for lack of raw materials he has to lay-off his workmen, it is necessary that he must submit to an enquiry by the Industrial Tribunal about the prudence of the management and the forethought displayed by it in anticipating and avoiding the difficulties. 
That is why we think in embarking upon an enquiry as to whether the appellant had shown sufficient foresight in managing its affairs, the Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction. Besides, as we have just indicated, its finding on the question of negligence is not supported by any evidence on record nor by probabilities in the case. In that connection, it is significant that subsequently the section in question has been closed and the retrenched workmen have been paid retrenchment compensation due to them.",1,0,TATANAGAR FOUNDRY COMPANY,THEIR WORKMEN
1963_37,"Since the dispute could not be settled amicably, the Union succeeded in persuading the Government of West Bengal to refer the dispute for adjudication to the Second Labour Court on the ground that the said discharge was not justified. That is how the discharge of Mr. Banerjee became an industrial dispute between the appellant and the respondents, its workmen represented by their Union.
Mr. Banerjee stated in his evidence that he had all the cases opened and he added, as he. had to, that the said cases were repacked for avoiding further deterioration. When he was asked how that could be done, he agreed that the metal straps had to be removed for opening of the boxes, but he added that he had arranged to have them restrapped and nailed. It is clear that the strapping is done in a factory by machines. Mr. Banerjee, however, suggested that he could manage to get the straps put and nailed with hands. 
This evidence is patently unreliable. Besides, it is significant that when he gave his explanation to Mr. Gupta Mr. Banerjee admitted that he had opened only 5 or 6 out of the 20 boxes in question though his report suggested that he had opened all the 20 boxes. Therefore, there can be no doubt that Mr. Guptas statetment is absolutely true and that Mr. Banerjee had made his report about the unsatisfactory condition of the contents of the 20 boxes without as much as opening any one of them. That being so, it is difficult to understand how the Labour Court could -have come to the conclusion that the order of discharge was not justified. The learned Solicitor-General, however, attempted to argue that there was nothing on the record to show that the 20 boxes which Mr. Gupta got opened were the same boxes in respect of which Mr. Banerjee had made his report. We do not think that having regard to the evidence given by Mr. Gupta and Mr. Banerjee and the explanation offered by the latter when he was called to Calcutta by Mr. Gupta, there is any room for such an ingenious suggestion. Both parties knew that they were talking about the same 20 boxes and so,, it is futile now to suggest that the 20 boxes which Mr. Gupta examined were different from the boxes in respect of which Mr. Banerjee had made his report. It was also suggested on behalf of the respondents that Mr. Gupta did not admit that he had received some letters from Mr. Banerjee in which he had complained that owing to heavy rains, conditions were not favourable for effective work in the area entrusted to him. It is true that when Mr. Gupta was asked about these letters, he said he did not remember if he had received them. We do not think that the answers given by Mr. Gupta in respect of these letters can be of any assistance to the respondents in discrediting Mr. Guptas evidence in any manner. On the whole, we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant acted bonafide in discharging Mr. Banerjees services when it accepted Mr. Guptas report and concurred with his conclusions that the explanation given by Mr. Banerjee was not satisfactory.",1,0,THE TATA OIL MILLS CO LTD,WORKMEN  ANR

 We are at a loss the understand as to how the High Court could pass such an order. Admittedly the disciplinary proceedings had commenced on 28 7 1998. Even if before that date the said respondent had been empanelled for promotion the Government cannot be prohibited from starting disciplinary proceedings if there are reasons for doing so. The High Court has not quashed the disciplinary proceedings and looking at the charges leveled against the respondent it cant of be said that there was any ulterior motive for the respondent being put under suspension. Furthermore where disciplinary proceedings are pending we are doubtful whether it was appropriate for the High Court to have directed that the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith especially when the High Court in the said order has permitted the disciplinary proceedings to continue. It is also difficult to appreciate the High Court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings could continue but no final order should be passed. No reasons for coming to this conclusion have been given.
 We therefore have no hesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The effect of this would be that Respondent 1 who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the High Court during the proceedings for contempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent would be placed under suspension forthwith till the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or the withdrawal of the suspension order by the Government.",1,0,Govt.

2003_794,"An Industrial unit run by M s. Diamond Marbles Pvt. Ltd respondent No 4 was brought to sale in terms of Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act 1951 for short the State Act by Rajasthan Financial Corporation respondent No 3. Appellant before us participated in auction and its bid having been accepted took possession of the said unit on 28 8 1987 pursuant to the agreement entered into between them. On 4 12 1987 the Additional Collector of Central Excise adjudicated in a proceeding arising out of show cause notice issued under Section 11A of the Central Excise Act to respondent No 4 in relation to certain goods that are said to have been removed between 13 8 1986 and 23 8 1986 and excise duty of Rs 1 04 586.17 and penalty of Rs 3 lakhs was levied and demanded.
Now taking the last contention first we may notice that this Court in Isha Marbles considered the scope of Section 24 of the Electricity Act and held that there is no charge over the property in question and when a premises comes to be owned or purchased by the auction purchaser he cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears when such purchaser seeks supply of electric energy or it is made clear in that decision that what matters is the contract entered into by the erstwhile consumer with the Board and the Board cannot seek the enforcement of contractual liability against the third party. Therefore this decision in Isha Marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.
In this case the liability arises under the Central Excise Act and Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules. The said Rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor.
The argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the State Act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good. Section 29 2 of the State Act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the Financial Corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been made by the owner of the property. When sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a sale made by the owner of the property necessarily Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules would be attracted.
We are not impressed with the argument that the State Act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the Central Excise Act. Each of them is a special enactment and unless in the operation of the same any conflict arises this aspect need not be examined. In this case no such conflict arises between the corporation and the Excise Department. Hence it is unnecessary to examine this aspect of the matter.",0,0,Macson Marbles Pvt.

2013_30,"Leave granted.
 The appellant A2 Azeez along with two others i.e. A1 Khalid and A3 Babu was tried by the Judicial Magistrate First Class I Aluva for offences punishable under Sections 457 and 380 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for short the IPC . By order dated 15 12 2000 learned Magistrate convicted the appellant under Section 457 of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further convicted for offence under Section 380 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years. The substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. A1 Khalid and A3 Babu were acquitted.
The Trial Court also acquitted A1 and A3 of the offence punishable under Section 457 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The Trial Court however observed that from the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 it is seen that theft had taken in the room in which PW2 was sleeping the thief entered the house and committed theft of gold chain which PW2 was wearing and therefore this act will be covered by Section 451 of the IPC i.e. house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment. The Trial Court further held that since the recovery of gold chain was effected on the basis of statement given by the appellant the only inference that can be drawn is that he committed the theft of gold chain and therefore the case is covered by Section 380 of the IPC i.e theft in a dwelling house. After observing that there is nothing in the evidence of PWs 1 to 8 to connect A1 and A3 with the crime the Trial Court acquitted them of all the offences. This view is affirmed by the Sessions Court and the High Court.
 We find it difficult to uphold the above view so far as it relates to the appellant. As we have already noted that FIR was registered after about sixteen days from the date of alleged theft. PWs 1 and 2 did not even realize that the chain was stolen. It is only when the accused were brought to their house after about sixteen days that they realized that the chain was stolen and FIR was lodged. The chain in question was being worn by PW2. It is stated to have been stolen while she was sleeping. It is inconceivable that she would not realize that she had lost her chain. The incident in our view is not unfolded truthfully. A1 and A3 have been rightly acquitted because nothing links them to the offence. But similar is the case with the appellant. The only evidence against him is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his instance. That cannot connect the appellant to the theft. The Trial Court has stated that since chain was recovered at the instance of the appellant the only inference which can be drawn is that he committed the theft. Drawing such inference in the facts of this case would be totally unjust.",1,0,Azeez,State Of Kerala
2013_35,"These appeals are directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan Jaipur Bench Jaipur in Criminal Appeal No 130 of 2000 dated 03.06.2005. The High Court while affirming the judgment of the Trial Court in Sessions Case No 49 99 dated 15.03.2000 has convicted Shri Ram A 1 under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code the IPC for short and reversed the judgment of the Trial Court and acquitted Shobha Ram A 2. It is the acquittal of A 2 which is called in question by the appellant  State of Rajasthan in Criminal Appeal No 592 of 2008.
In the case of an offence involving physical violence the person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present and such presence of those who in one way or the other facilitate the execution of the common design is itself tantamount to actual participation in the criminal act 
 Insofar as common intention is concerned it is a state of mind of an accused which can be inferred objectively from his conduct displayed in the course of commission of crime and also from prior and subsequent attendant circumstances. As observed in Hari Ram vs.State of U.P 2004 8 SCC 146 the existence of direct proof of common intention is seldom available and therefore such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. Therefore in order to bring home the charge of common intention the prosecution has to establish by evidence whether direct or circumstantial that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence before a person can be vicariously convicted for the act of the other.
 The facts in the present case in the light of the evidences on record are that A 1 and A 2 are brothers having an old enmity with the deceased resulting in a constant skirmish over the well located in their lands. On the said date of incident the animosity culminated to an assault on the deceased by the accused persons when the deceased was nearing his land. It has come in the evidence of PW 6 that A 1 was assaulting the deceased with stones and A 2 was sitting on the chest of the deceased. The aforesaid chain of events gives a clear picture of the whole incident that had taken place on that fateful day. The evidence of PW 6 when seen in entirety and in its proper perspective we can conclude that both the accused persons i.e. A 1 and A 2 had a common intention to assault and kill the deceased person with A 2 as a participant in the crime with the intention of lending weight to the commission of an offence pursuant to a pre concerted plan.",1,1,State Of Rajasthan,Shobha Ram
2013_57,"These applications have been preferred under Order XVIII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules 1966 for short the Rules against the order of the Registrar dated 28.8.2012 alleging that the applications under Order XVIII Rule 5 of the Rules lodging the applications for clarification modification of the Judgment dated 11.1.2012 of this Court in Civil Appeal Nos281 282 of 2012 cannot be sustained in law.
Such applications if they are in substance review applications deserve to be rejected straight away inasmuch as the attempt is obviously to bypass Order XL Rule 3 relating to circulation of the application in chambers for consideration without oral hearing. By describing an application as one for clarification or modification  though it is really one of review  a party cannot be permitted to circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and indirectly obtain a hearing in the open court. What cannot be done directly cannot be permitted to be done indirectly See in this connection a detailed order of the then Registrar of this Court in Sone Lal v. State of U.P deprecating a similar practice 18. We therefore agree with the learned Solicitor General that the Court should not permit hearing of such an application for clarification modification or recall if the application is in substance one for review. In that event the Court could either reject the application straight away with or without costs or permit withdrawal with leave to file a review application to be listed initially in chambers. 19. What we have said above equally applies to such applications filed after rejection of review applications particularly when a second review is not permissible under the Rules. Under Order XL Rule 5 a second review is not permitted. The said Rule reads as follows 5. Where an application for review of any judgment and order has been made and disposed of no further application for review shall be entertained in the same matter. 20. We should not however be understood as saying that in no case an application for clarification modification or recall is maintainable after the first disposal of the matter. All that we are saying is that once such an application is listed in Court the Court will examine whether it is in substance in the nature of review and is to be rejected with or without costs or requires to be withdrawn with leave to file a review petition to be listed in chambers by circulation. Point 1 is decided accordingly.
 We are of the view that the ratio laid down in the above mentioned Judgment squarely applies to the facts of this case as well. Generally an application for correction of a typographical error or omission of a word etc in a Judgment or order would lie but a petition which is intended to review an order or Judgment under Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in criminal proceedings except on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the record could not be achieved by filing an application for clarification modification recall or rehearing for which a properly constituted review is the remedy.",0,0,Collector Dist.Gwalior & Anr,Cine Exhibitors P.Ltd.& Anr
2013_95,"This appeal is directed against judgment dated 3.2.2010 of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court whereby the writ appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed and the order passed by the learned Single Judge negating his challenge to the order of punishment was upheld.
 The appellant joined service as Junior Assistant in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission for short the Commission in 1973. He was promoted as Assistant in 1975 and as Assistant Selection Grade in 1988. In February 1990 the appellant was sanctioned unearned leave from 12.2.1990 to 25.2.1990 for private work. During that period P Section of the Commission is said to have directed him to work as Invigilator at Bharathiyar Women Arts College Chennai which was one of the centers for the written examination on 17.2.1990 and 18.2.1990 held for recruitment of Assistant Surgeons.
Unfortunately the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court failed to take cognizance of the admission made by the Chief Invigilator that on a request made by him five substitute Invigilators including R.Mahalingam had been appointed by P Section of the Commission and he had produced the order of his appointment and that the question papers etc had been brought by him i.e the Chief Invigilator from the office of the Commission and opened seals in the presence of two other invigilators . The High Court also did not pay due weightage to the fact that the appellant had not handled the question papers at any stage and he had no role in distribution of wrong question papers to six candidates. These errors and omissions on the part of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench in our considered view are fatal to their concurrence with the finding recorded by the Enquiry Officer the Secretary and the Chairman of the Commission that the appellant had unauthorisedly worked as Invigilator on 17.2.1990 and 18.2.1990.
 At the cost of repetition it deserves to be mentioned that the appellant had no role to play in the matter of mixing of the question papers of the afternoon examination with the morning examination. Before the Enquiry Officer no evidence was produced by the Commission to prove that the appellant had the custody of the question papers. Rather the statements made by the Chief Invigilator before the Inspector Crime Investigation Department and the Controller of Examinations clearly show that he had collected the question papers from the office of the Commission that the seals were opened at the examination center in the presence of two persons and the appellant had not played any role in the exercise. Therefore the appellant cannot be blamed for distribution of wrong question papers to the candidates or the so called leakage of the question papers.",1,1,R.Mahalingam,"Chairman,Tnpsc & Anr"
