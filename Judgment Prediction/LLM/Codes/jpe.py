  prompt = f"""Task: Given a Supreme Court of India case proceeding enclosed in angle brackets <>, your task is to predict the decision of the case (with respect to the appelant) \
  and provide an explaination for the decision. \

  Prediction: Given a case proceeding, the task is to predict the decision 0 or 1, where the label 1 corresponds to the acceptance of the appeal/petition \
  of the appellant/petitioner and the label 0 corresponds to the rejection of the appeal/petition of the appellant/petitioner, \
  Explanation: The task is to explain how you arrived at the decision by predicting important sentences that lead to the decision. \

  Context: Answer in a consistent style as shown in the following two examples: \

  case_proceeding: We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench. On a plain reading of the language of sections 12 and 50 it seems clear to us that the Act was given retrospective operation only to a limited extent and execution proceedings and appeals were excluded from this effect and were to be governed by the provisions of the law in force at the time when the decrees were passed. The concluding words of section 50 and there- upon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings fully bear out this construction. Mr. Daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the Act, and that section 12 of the Act which gives protection to tenants should \
  A. I. R. 1949 Bom. 210. be construed as having retrospective effect. In our opinion this contention is not sound. Section 50 cannot be de- scribed as a section providing merely for transfer of pend- ing cases to courts having jurisdiction to deal with them. It is on the other hand a repeal section in the new stat- ute. \
  It repeals the two earlier statutes, and while repeal- ing them it provides that the repeal shall not affect executions and appeals and that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all pending suits which shall be transferred to the courts having jurisdiction to hear them under section 28 of the Act. We are also inclined to agree with the view of the Full Bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective. Sub-section (2) clearly relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force. \
  It cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the Act was put on the statute book. Sub-section (3) which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into operation because it in terms states in such suit and not in any suit. Such suit can only be a suit referred to in subsec- tions (2) and (3) of section 12. \

  case_proceeding: Mr. Gumaste, who appears for the appellant, says that his claim is not a claim against the Government but in that case be ought to strike out the Government. He is not prepared to strike out the Government because if he does they will not be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals. Therefore, he wants to make the Government a party in order that they may be bound. But, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the Government as to the way in which the property should be dealt with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind Government. They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was ousted. It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay v. Hormusji Manekji (74 I.A. 103) that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first. In my opinion, this decision does not apply here. Their Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876. That provides that \
  no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to (b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assessment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Government. As pointed out by Strangman K. C. on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, authorised must mean duly authorised and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11-4-1930 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code. Thus, before the exclusion of the Civil Courts jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires. Consequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar. But the position here is different. We are concerned here with section 4 (a) under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises. The section is general and bars all claims against the Crown relating to lands held as Saranjam. That is to say, even if the Government act is relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land. \
  There is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration. One set of decision holds that that does not amount to a claim against Government. Dattatraya Vishwanath v. The Secretary of State for India I.L.R. 1948 Bom. 809 at 820 is typical of that view. \
